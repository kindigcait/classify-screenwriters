OVERTURE:
1 IMAGES of Tompkins Square Park. Over the tableaus we 1
HEAR two women talking and laughing.
2 EXT. PARK. MORNING 2
We find Frances and Sophie, both 27, setting up a little
performance space in front of a statue.
FRANCES
Okay, ready?
SOPHIE
Yep.
Sophie sings and plays a shitty guitar badly. Frances
dances.
When people walk by, they both stop and yell:
FRANCES AND SOPHIE
Give us your MONEY!!!
They laugh. Sometimes someone will give them change.
Usually a creepy guy.
FRANCES
(alone now)
Give us--
(laughs)
Come on!
FRANCES AND SOPHIE
Give us your money!!!
CUT TO: Music swells.
MONTAGE
3 Frances and Sophie run through the park together. They 3
dump what little money they earned into another
musician’s guitar case. Frances makes sure to keep a
dollar bill.
4 They run into the subway. 4
5 Subway. Sophie sits. Frances stands above her. She 5
leans down to say something.
6 Frances cooks. Scrambled eggs and stir fry. Sophie 6
enters frame and gets plates out of the cupboard.
FRANCES
I tried a frittata but it’s more of
a scramble.
7 Frances is reading and Sophie is knitting. 7
FRANCES
Oh, this is interesting.
She reads a sentence out loud from “Sincerity and
Authenticity” by Lionel Trilling. Sophie nods.
8 Sophie works out to a video in the tiny living room. 8
Frances half watches.
9 Frances and Sophie smoke in two separate adjacent 9
windows. They both lean outside.
We see them talking outside the windows.
10 They sit across from each other in their living room. 10
FRANCES (V.O.)
(doing a Jamaican accent)
Okay, my father is from Jamaica,
mon, and--
(doing an Irish accent)
--my mother is from Ireland.
(trying to combine the accents)
So I talk like this...
They both crack up.
SOPHIE (V.O.)
(doing a Russian accent)
My mother is from Russia and--
(doing a Southern accent)
--and my father is from Alabama.
(trying to combine)
So I talk like this.
10A They play a game together. 10A
11 They do their laundry at the laundromat across the 11
street.
12 They both lie in bed and watch The Day After Tomorrow on 12
the computer. Sophie falls asleep first and Frances
quietly puts the computer away.
Frances makes a move out of the bed.
2.
SOPHIE
(eyes closed)
Don’t be stupid.
FRANCES
I should sleep in my own bed.
SOPHIE
Why?
FRANCES
Because I bought it.
SOPHIE
Stay. But take off your socks.
FRANCES
Okay...Thank you.
SOPHIE
Shut up.
FADE OUT
3.
PART ONE:
13 CLOSE on a photo of a bony, bug-eyed cat that resembles 13
an alien.
FRANCES (O.S.)
It’s hairless?
DAN (O.S.)
No, it has fine curly hair.
CLOSE on Frances looking down. She looks up briefly,
attempts a smile and looks back down.
CLOSE on her hand touching the back of her neck.
She stares at a photograph in her lap.
She is wearing dance clothes underneath a knit dress, and
her hair is pulled back. A bulky canvas backpack sits
beside her. She’ll have it the whole film.
CLOSE on her fingers smoothing the skin on her arm.
DAN
(excited)
There’s this house in Westchester,
the basement is all Cornish Rexes,
it smells awful, the top floor is
Siamese cats.
She nods and hands Dan, early 30’s, back the photo. He
sits opposite her on a thrift-store couch, a manilla
envelope in his lap.
FRANCES
I’m allergic to cats.
DAN
They’re hypo-allergenic.
(quick smile)
This is a special Frances kitty.
FRANCES
Oh...who knew?
He passes her back a photo.
DAN
This one is the runt. Which is
cheaper but I think is the best one
anyway. I figured one runt and one
regular?
4.
Frances hesitates.
DAN
I put a hundred dollar down payment
on each cat...or eighty for the
runt and a hundred for the other
one.
Pause.
FRANCES
Why not get one cat?
DAN
A cat needs a buddy. If you get
one cat you need to get two cats.
FRANCES
I’ll give you two hundred dollars
to get no cats.
He nods, somewhat hurt and annoyed, glances back at the
photo of the runt, starts stacking the photos and tucking
them back into the envelope. Frances comes over and sits
next to him, puts her hand on his back.
FRANCES
So, who will take care of them if
you go away?
DAN
I thought...we’d get them together.
FRANCES
And move them back and forth
between our apartments?
DAN
No...I thought maybe you could move
in with me...
Frances hesitates.
FRANCES
(strangely)
Oh, wow...
DAN
Do you want to move in with me?
5.
FRANCES
Yeah.
DAN
Yeah?
FRANCES
Yes.
(pause)
I mean, I do have this other thing.
DAN
What “other thing?”
FRANCES
Well...I don’t know. I promised
Sophie I’d stay through the lease.
He sighs deeply.
FRANCES
Is that bad? I’m sorry. I feel
bad.
DAN
Can’t she find someone else?
FRANCES
Yeah. But, it’s my friend...
DAN
Uh huh.
FRANCES
I want to move in with you.
DAN
Okay.
FRANCES
I feel bad.
DAN
Don’t feel bad. Forget it.
6.
FRANCES
No...
(off his expression)
What?
DAN
Nothing.
FRANCES
You’re mad.
DAN
I’m not mad. I’m disappointed.
FRANCES
I feel bad.
DAN
Stop feeling bad, Frances! I asked
you to move in, you said, No.
Her phone rings.
FRANCES
But I can’t.
DAN
You can, you don’t want to.
She looks at her phone.
DAN
Who is it?
FRANCES
It’s okay, I don’t need to get it.
DAN
Who is it?
FRANCES
It’s Sophie. I’ll call her back.
DAN
Just pick up the phone.
FRANCES
Do you mind?
DAN
(frustrated)
Answer it.
She does.
7.
FRANCES
(into phone, a voice)
Hey girl...waz up wid you? Where
you at?...I can’t come now...
(laugh)
Are you drunk?...I can’t...I love
you...
Dan watches her without expression. He gets up and gets
a beer from the fridge.
FRANCES
(laughs)
Dumpling house!...I love you...I
can’t really talk now...I love
you...Okay!...I love you.
She hangs up and looks at him somewhat sheepishly.
FRANCES
She’s with Benji and Lev at this
party in Chinatown.
(pause)
They’re drunk.
He drinks his beer.
DAN
I don’t know...maybe this isn’t
working.
FRANCES
I’m sorry.
DAN
Me too.
FRANCES
(a new idea)
Maybe...
(pause)
Forget it.
DAN
What?
FRANCES
I do want to pay you for the cats.
DAN
I’m not going to take money from
you. But I’m going to get the cats
anyway.
8.
FRANCES
But then you’re going to be a
single guy with two cats.
DAN
Why...why am I going to be single?
FRANCES
With two cats.
DAN
No, I know. I mean why would I be
single?
FRANCES
I don’t know... I thought you said
this wasn’t working. I mean, if we
don’t move in together. If we
can’t move in together.
DAN
We can move in together.
FRANCES
I don’t know...I don’t know if I
believe anything I’m saying.
DAN
Uh huh.
(pause)
This hasn’t been great for a while.
FRANCES
(nods)
This hasn’t been great for a while.
This has not...
She looks at him sadly. Frances puts on a too-big bomber
jacket, not really cool, just something a friend gave her
once.
DAN
Where are you going?
FRANCES
I guess home. I’m really tired. I’m
always so tired.
She puts on her backpack.
DAN
(sadly)
Let’s move in together.
9.
14 INT. APARTMENT PARTY. NIGHT 14
CLOSE on Frances (wearing the same clothes). She walks
through a crowd and leans in to Sophie. Sophie is
talking to Benji and Lev.
WIDER: They drink, dance in a silly way, laugh.
Lev plays a record. He tries very hard to flirt with
Frances.
FRANCES
I can't get interested in art or
books or movies about animals.
Animals in conversation. The
animals have to talk or be at war
for me to be interested.
15 INT. SUBWAY STATION. NIGHT 15
No one is on the platform. Frances pulls down her pants
and pees into the tracks, holding onto the pillar to
suspend her bare bottom out over the track.
Sophie looks for a train. She turns to see--
SOPHIE
(laughing)
Don’t hit the third rail!
Sophie’s attention goes to an MTA flyer posted.
SOPHIE
Shit! The three’s not running!
16 INT. CAB. NIGHT 16
Frances lying in Sophie’s lap.
17 INT. SOPHIE/FRANCES APARTMENT. WINDOW SILL. NIGHT 17
Frances, in her same clothes, smokes a cigarette by the
open window. Sophie, sleep-wear on, sits next to her
with her legs propped up on the sill.
Sophie extends her hand for the cigarette.
SOPHIE
I want a sip.
FRANCES
Do you want your own?
10.
SOPHIE
I want a sip.
Frances reluctantly hands it over.
FRANCES
The coffee people are right. We are
like a lesbian couple that doesn’t
have sex anymore.
Sophie hands it back and exits frame.
FRANCES
Wait! Come back!
SOPHIE (O.S.)
Don’t pick at your face.
FRANCES
(kind of to herself,
touching a pimple)
I don’t like smoking alone.
She puts out her own cigarette and follows Sophie to the
bedroom. Sophie is writing an email on her phone.
FRANCES
Me and Dan don’t have sex
anymore...didn’t have sex anymore.
SOPHIE
Yeah, that’s why you broke up.
FRANCES
Or if it happened then he would
just - he only had one way that he
could finish.
SOPHIE
I hate that.
18 Sophie enters the bathroom. Washes her face. 18
FRANCES
It was always with me facing flat
on the bed from behind. Which
just...everything that matters was
covered up.
SOPHIE
It’s like with me and Patch -
11.
FRANCES
(making fun)
Yo Patchy!
SOPHIE
(also making fun)
‘Sup bra?
(continue, matter of fact)
The way he always likes to come in
my face.
FRANCES
Yeah, CLASSY. Patch is the kind of
dude who says “I gotta take a
leak.”
SOPHIE
(cringing)
And wears pre-distressed baseball
hats. But...he’s a nice guy...for
today.
Frances joins Sophie in the bathroom.
FRANCES
I should feel bad that I went to
the party.
SOPHIE
You deserved it. You just got out
of relationship jail.
FRANCES
I think Dan was an alcoholic.
SOPHIE
He was.
Sophie leaves frame.
FRANCES
He wasn’t a real alcoholic.
Frances leaves frame.
FRANCES
But sometimes he would have twelve
beers.
19 Sophie lies in bed. She’s still typing on her phone. 19
FRANCES
Stop playing on your phone.
12.
Frances flops down into bed next to her.
SOPHIE
It’s the only thing with interweb
in this house. I have to answer
work emails.
FRANCES
(to herself)
The neighbors changed their code.
SOPHIE
(re: her phone)
Hey!
FRANCES
What?
SOPHIE
Lev is asking for your number.
FRANCES
Give it to him!
SOPHIE
(not judgemental)
You did just break up with Dan
today.
FRANCES
Just do it.
She types in the number. Frances gets her phone from a
bag and stares at it. Waiting. Sophie goes back to typing
on her phone.
Frances’ phone chirps. Reads out loud.
FRANCES
“Ahoy sexy. Are you around this
week?” Ahoy sexy?
SOPHIE
That is actually very gay.
FRANCES
Am I nautically sensual?
SOPHIE
You’re funny.
FRANCES
Lev didn’t laugh at any of my jokes
tonight.
13.
SOPHIE
You are SO funny.
FRANCES
Should I text back “Starboard anal
sex?”
Sophie laughs. Puts her phone down. Snuggles down in bed.
SOPHIE
(settling)
No.
FRANCES
Tell me the story of us...
SOPHIE
Again? Well, Frances, we are going
to take over the world...
FRANCES
...You’ll be this awesomely bitchy
publishing mogul...
SOPHIE
...And you’ll be a famous modern
dancer and I’ll publish a really
expensive book about you...
FRANCES
...That d-bags we make fun of buy
to put on their coffee tables...
SOPHIE
...and we co-own a vacation
apartment in Paris...
FRANCES
...and we will have lovers...
SOPHIE
...and no children...
FRANCES
...and we will speak at college
graduations...
SOPHIE
...and honorary degrees!
FRANCES
...so many honorary degrees.
14.
20 INT. BEDROOM. LATER. 20
Sophie and Frances are asleep in the same bed.
21 INT. DANCE STUDIO. DAY. 21
Frances warms up alone in an empty studio. While holding
a position, Frances notices a woman pass by the open
doorway.
22 INT. DANCE OFFICE. MOMENTS LATER. 22
Frances pops her head into the outer office.
FRANCES
Hey!
Colleen, 40’s, beautiful, retired dancer - drops
everything she’s holding.
COLLEEN
Jesus!
FRANCES
Sorry. I’m here.
COLLEEN
I don’t really have time to talk,
I’m doing the job of three people
here, but I can see you after
rehearsal.
FRANCES
I read that article in the Times --
you must be so happy!
COLLEEN
Oh yeah, thanks, I forget I make my
own work sometimes, but thanks.
FRANCES
I usually hate that woman’s
writing.
COLLEEN
Right. Well, thank you Frances.
FRANCES
I actually, I had a couple of
questions. I’m trying to be proactive
about my life.
15.
COLLEEN
(getting it)
I’ll see if I have some studio
openings for choreography time --
FRANCES
-- Uh, no. I wanted to know if
there were any more classes at the
school that I could teach...I’m a
little, I’m kind of broke.
COLLEEN
I’ll check, but I’m all full I
think --
FRANCES
-- I thought so, I’m just proud of
myself for asking.
COLLEEN
Well, we’ll probably use you and
some other apprentices for the
Christmas show, so, that’s
something.
FRANCES
That’s GREAT.
Frances just stands there.
FRANCES
I just wanted to say I really look
up to you, and I just, I think
you’re great.
COLLEEN
Ha! A beat-up old dancer doing
paperwork?
Frances still stands there a little goofily. Colleen
decides to wrap it up:
COLLEEN
I really need to do all that
paperwork now - I’m running
rehearsal today so I’ll see you in
there.
FRANCES
Bye.
Frances disappears.
16.
23 INT. DANCE STUDIO. LATER 23
About twenty two dancers are rehearsing. Colleen runs the
rehearsal.
Frances is paired with Rachel, 25, about her height and
build. They laugh and talk in between working.
RACHEL
Do you have more gum?
FRANCES
What? No.
(taking the gum out of her
mouth)
I don’t even know where this gum
came from.
Frances dances behind her, mirroring her movements. Other
pairs of dancers do the same.
Colleen claps her hands:
COLLEEN
Understudies, out!
Frances and a few others go to the side and watch the
primary company dance.
24 INT. SMALL DANCE STUDIO. LATER. 24
Frances teaches ballet to a group of young girls.
25 INT. SUPERMARKET - LATE DAY 25
Frances shops.

27 EXT. MIDTOWN CORPORATE BUILDING - EARLY EVENING 27
Frances waits outside a building, watching people exit.
She sees Sophie.
FRANCES
AHOY SEXY! AHOY!
SOPHIE
(laughing)
AHOY SEXY!
17.
28 EXT. BRYANT PARK - EVENING 28
Sophie and Frances eat. The park is almost deserted. It’s
twilight and too cold for a picnic.
They have pushed several tables together and made a
banquet table and spread everything out. They toast two
Pellegrino bottles.
29 INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT 29
On the subway. Sophie keeps checking her phone.
FRANCES
No service.
SOPHIE
Sometimes there is, for a second...
FRANCES
What is going on with that phone,
lady?
SOPHIE
I didn’t want to do it without
knowing it was okay with you first.
FRANCES
Do what?
SOPHIE
(putting her phone away)
I want to move into this apartment
with Phoebe. It’s this great
apartment in the West Village which
is what I’ve always wanted and you
know that but I don’t want to do it
if you’re not okay with it --
FRANCES
Oh --
SOPHIE
But they need to know by tomorrow.
So I kind of need to tell them
something today...
FRANCES
Who have you been emailing? *
SOPHIE
My parents, for help with the
broker’s fee and stuff.
Revision (05/14/2012) 18.
FRANCES
You have to pay OUR rent.
SOPHIE
I know and I’ll pay until the end
of the lease but it’s only for
another two months anyway. Are you
okay with it? I really don’t want
to do it if you’re not okay with
it.
FRANCES
I sort of thought we were going to
renew the lease. *
SOPHIE *
Yeah, but we never talked about it. *
FRANCES
I could have moved in with Dan.
SOPHIE
Not if you broke up.
FRANCES
That’s why we broke up.
SOPHIE
Really?
FRANCES
No.
SOPHIE
It’s LITERALLY on my favorite
street. Phoebe said it was too good
to pass up.
FRANCES
You hate Phoebe.
SOPHIE
She’s okay.
FRANCES
We make fun of her.
SOPHIE
She said I’d always regret it if I
don’t just go for it.
FRANCES
Then go for it.
Revision (05/14/2012) 19.
SOPHIE
We’re both really clean.
FRANCES
I said go for it.
SOPHIE
I wish it was going to be with you.
FRANCES
Yeah.
SOPHIE
But Phoebe found the place.
FRANCES
Right.
SOPHIE
Is this train skipping DeKalb? *
She gets up to look at the subway map. *
SOPHIE
We could look for another place
together, if you want, but it’s
really hard to find stuff in the
West Village.
FRANCES
I can’t afford the West Village. *
SOPHIE
I know it’s so expensive. My raise *
just barely covers the rent. *
FRANCES
You should take the place. *
SOPHIE
I’m not leaving you - I’m just *
moving neighborhoods. *
Frances’s eyes well up.
SOPHIE
Are you okay?
FRANCES
Yeah. Totally.
Frances is messing with her hand.
Revision (05/14/2012) 20.
SOPHIE
What are you doing?
FRANCES
I just put my ring on my thumb and
I’m having trouble getting it off.
SOPHIE
Hold your hand over your head.
It’ll drain the blood out.
Frances does.
FRANCES
I look like I’m asking a question.
SOPHIE
I’m not doing anything wrong. Our
lease was going to be up in two
months anyway.
They ride in silence, Frances’ hand over her head.
30 INT. FRANCES AND SOPHIE’S APARTMENT. DAYS LATER. MORNING 30
Frances gets a tea bag out and puts it in a mug. She
rattles around the cabinets looking for a kettle.
Not finding a kettle, she boils water in a saucepan.
While she’s waiting for the water to boil, she lights a
cigarette.
The apartment is nearly empty. It turns out Sophie had
most of the furniture and Frances had most of the books.
It looks like the crack den of a pretty well educated
junkie.
The water boils. Frances tries to pour it into the mug,
but scalds herself. She kicks the kitchen cabinet.
Frances is on the phone. She moves.
FRANCES
(on the phone)
We bought the kettle TOGETHER!
REMEMBER? At the Mexican
superstore? Jesus! BRING IT BACK.
OR BUY ME ANOTHER KETTLE.
21.
31 INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY. DAY 31
Mailbox. Frances is checking the mail. Sees something
she likes. Tax rebate! Whoops and runs out onto the
street.
32 EXT. BANK. DAY. MOMENTS LATER 32
Frances leaves the bank. Is still elated. Looks around,
unsure what to do next. Her elation leaves her slightly.
She pulls out her phone and scrolls. Half shrugs, calls
someone.
FRANCES
Hey I just got a tax rebate, want
to go out to dinner?!
33 INT. RESTAURANT. NIGHT 33
Lev (from the party) is scrolling through his phone. He
finds the photo he was looking for and hands the phone to
Frances across the table.
LEV
This is me in the locker room of
the Knicks.
FRANCES
Wow!
LEV
Sophie said you liked basketball.
FRANCES
That was just one time.
Frances changes the picture.
FRANCES
Wow! Crazy!
LEV
(looking at the picture)
Oh, yeah, I was goofing around on
this Vintage Triumph I think I’m
going to buy.
FRANCES
Motorcycles are so loud.
LEV
What?
22.
FRANCES
I mean, you can’t listen to music
while you’re on a motorcycle.
LEV
But you’re on a motorcycle.
Lev takes back his phone, finds a new picture.
LEV
Check it. This is me with Jay Leno.
FRANCES
He’s such a dick.
LEV
I know, but don’t you just love
him?
The waitress comes up to give them the check. Frances
grabs it and puts her credit card in.
LEV
No!
FRANCES
Yes!
LEV
NO!
FRANCES
No...I mean, YES! I’m the one with
the tax rebate!
WAITRESS
Can I take this?
FRANCES
Yes!
LEV
Oh...fine.
The waitress leaves.
LEV
Just because you bought dinner
doesn’t mean I’m going to sleep
with you.
FRANCES
(not getting it)
I’m not trying to sleep with you...
23.
LEV
No, I’m pretending to be a
liberated woman.
FRANCES
Oh, got it.
LEV
Thanks for paying. That was very
sweet. You’re a lady.
He takes her hand. She lets him. The waitress comes back.
Frances immediately withdraws her hand.
WAITRESS
I’m sorry, but the card didn’t go
through, do you have another card
you want to try?
FRANCES
Oh, shit! Sorry, yes, um, this is a
debit card?
WAITRESS
Only credit cards or cash.
FRANCES
Okay.
(to Lev)
I’m so embarrassed, I’m not a real
person yet.
LEV
I got it.
FRANCES
(getting up from the table)
No, no, no, I’m just going to go
run and get some cash.
34 EXT. STREETS AROUND THE RESTAURANT. NIGHT 34
Frances hustles down the street, looking for an ATM.
35 INT. DELI. NIGHT 35
Frances runs in.
FRANCES
Where is your ATM?
DELI GUY
Not working. No ATM.
24.
36 EXT. STREETS AROUND THE RESTAURANT. NIGHT 36
She looks for a bank or something. She stops a woman.
FRANCES
Do you know where a bank is?
WOMAN
Um, there’s a Bank of America about
five blocks up.
37 EXT. BANK. NIGHT 37
Frances punches in her pin in the ATM area of a closed B
of A while a homeless man looks on.
“Do you accept the $3.00 service charge?” She sighs, her
finger hovering over the button, accepts.
As she passes the homeless guy:
FRANCES
Sorry, sorry...
38 EXT. STREETS AROUND THE RESTAURANT. NIGHT 38
Frances runs back to the restaurant. Falls. Hard. Gets up
and keeps running.
39 INT. RESTAURANT. NIGHT 39
The restaurant is considerably more cleared out. Frances
has been gone a long time.
She sits down plunks the money down, happy. Lev is on the
phone.
LEV
I’ll ask her and let you
know...okay, man, see you.
He hangs up.
LEV
Sorry, that was Benji. You know, my
Sophie.
Frances is flushed and out of breath.
LEV
You go to Switzerland?
25.
FRANCES
(breathing heavy)
Have I been to Switzerland? No.
LEV
No, did you go to -- I mean, where
were you?
FRANCES
I’m sorry, I had so much trouble
finding --
She casually picks up the last bit of her wine and downs
it. She puts her glass down, and wipes at her face with
the napkin. She looks at the napkin, it has streaks of
red.
LEV
What the fuck?
She tries to trace the blood up her arm to its source.
LEV
You’re bleeding.
FRANCES
I can’t find it.
LEV
Somewhere on your arm...
She feels her arm, trying to figure it out. Her elbow.
FRANCES
Shit. Sorry.
LEV
Don’t apologize to me.
FRANCES
Oh, damn it. Oh, let me, I’m going
to go to the bathroom, just one
second.
40 INT. LEV AND BENJI’S APARTMENT. NIGHT. 40
Frances stands in their apartment. Totally enamored with
it.
FRANCES
This place is pretty awesome.
Lev enters with a First Aid Kit.
26.
LEV
I’m a First Responder.
FRANCES
You didn’t have to do that.
LEV
(opening the Bandaid)
You’re injured.
FRANCES
I know, but I’m fine.
He places the bandage on her arm.
LEV
There.
FRANCES
Like a boy scout... Sophie makes
fun of me because I can’t account
for my bruises. We’re not living
together anymore.
LEV
Really?
FRANCES
Yeah, I’m going to have to find a
place to live. I can’t afford to
stay there alone. I was kind of
thinking Washington Heights...?
LEV
(lighting a cigarette)
The chick crashing in the little
room might be moving to Portland
next month.
FRANCES
Oh, that’s good to know.
(then)
You smoke inside?
LEV
Yeah, don’t you?
FRANCES
No.
LEV
Want to?
27.
He offers her a cigarette. Lights it for her with a
special lighter.
FRANCES
This makes me feel like a bad
mother in 1987.
LEV
Wanna see my room?
41 INT. LEV’S ROOM. MOMENTS LATER. 41
Frances is looking at the framed pictures on the wall.
They are old and yellowed.
FRANCES
Is this your family?
LEV
Nope.
They are quiet a little too long. Lev moves towards her
and puts his hand on her shoulder. Frances glances at the
hand, and instantly makes a face and a strange noise that
is definitely negative.
It’s something that if she had thought about for one
second more that she wouldn’t have done.
Lev moves away.
They hear Benji come through the door. He has two girls
with him. They make a lot of noise.
RANDOM GIRL #1 (O.S.)
Oh my GOD! This place is AMAZING!
LEV
Benji’s home.
42 INT. LEV AND BENJI’S APARTMENT. LIVING ROOM. A LITTLE 42
LATER.
One girl dances to music. Lev plays cribbage with another
girl. Flirting heavily with her - looking at her cards,
teasing her.
Benji and Frances are talking. Frances drinks a scotch
out of a proper scotch glass.
28.
BENJI
I love dance. I dated a dancer in
high school and her teacher said I
could have really had a future in
it.
LEV
(joking but serious)
You liar. He’s a liar.
BENJI
No I’m not! Ask anyone from school!
(to Frances)
I really to love dance.
FRANCES
It’s pretty great...I mean it’s a
hard world, but -
LEV
Do us a dance!
FRANCES
I feel weird...
BENJI
Just one move.
Frances gets up does something quickly and sits back
down.
BENJI
That was GREAT!
LEV
You should be in this music video
my friend is working on. I’ll hook
you guys up.
FRANCES
(to herself)
You guys are...like magic.
BENJI
Is Noodle Champion still open? I’m
starving.
LEV
I don’t think so...
BENJI
All we have is...we have eggs. I
want something PREPARED. And
BROUGHT to me.
29.
FRANCES
Wait!
43 INT. LEV AND BENJI’S APARTMENT. KITCHEN. LATER 43
Frances has the stove going with a couple of items.
44 INT. LEV AND BENJI’S APARTMENT. LIVING ROOM. LATER 44
Frances serves everyone omelettes prettily. People
compliment her and the food.
FRANCES
It’s Sophie’s recipe, but...
She does a little twirl of happiness.
45 INT. LEV AND BENJI’S APARTMENT. LIVING ROOM. LATER. 45
The other two girls leave. Kiss everyone on the cheek.
LEV
(to his girl)
I’ll call you. We’ll shoot some
pigeons.
FRANCES
And I’ll let you know about my
show.
RANDOM GIRL #2
Yes! Please! I love your hair.
FRANCES
Thanks.
46 Everyone’s gone, Frances moves to the couch between Lev 46
and Benji.
FRANCES
This is the best night I’ve had
since Sophie dumped me.
She basks in it.
FRANCES
(nods, half-hearted)
I should probably go, too.
LEV
Make a left and a left out of the
building and the F is on the other
side of the bridge on East
Broadway.
30.
BENJI
You’ll see a 99 Cent Store --
FRANCES
Okay, yeah. I should go.
(beat, indicating the extra
room)
Is that chick really moving to
Portland?
BENJI
Yeah.
LEV
Before you go, do another dance.
FRANCES
(this time eager)
Ok!
She gets up and starts to dance. The boys love it.

Revision (05/14/2012) 31.
PART TWO
47 EXT. CHINATOWN. DUSK. 47
Music swells. Frances runs through the streets of
Chinatown, bomber jacket and backpack on. She’s running,
almost dancing through the streets. She bursts into the
apartment.
48 INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT. 48
Frances is asleep. She hears people having sex. She opens
her eyes, stirs. Closes her eyes.
CUT TO:
49 The two boys, Benji and Lev, run into the bedroom and 49
jump on top of her bed, play-tickling her and body
slamming her.
It’s morning.
50 INT. KITCHEN TABLE. LATER 50
Benji on his computer, smoking a cigarette. Still in a Tshirt
and pajama bottoms. Frances on her computer,
backpack on, ready to leave. Both drinking Folgers
instant coffee.
BENJI
What time did you get in last
night?
FRANCES
Um, late. Like 1:00.
BENJI
Why didn’t you come in and say hi?
FRANCES
I’m sorry -- I thought you were
asleep.
BENJI
I wasn’t asleep. I heard you come
in.
FRANCES
Then you knew what time I got in?
BENJI
(ignoring her question)
I’m working on some sample skits
for Saturday Night Live.
32.
(MORE)
I know a producer there who said I
could probably get a job writing
for them.
FRANCES
Cool.
LEV
That’s such a lie.
Lev has come out of his room. Fully dressed, bare feet. A
girl, Nessa, trails after him. She’s about twenty. Very
thin. Not wearing pants, just underwear and a big tshirt.
LEV
Guys. This is Nessa.
BENJI
Hey.
FRANCES
(putting out her hand to shake)
Hello. I’m Frances.
NESSA
Lev and I were going to make bacon
egg bagels. You want some?
FRANCES
Oh, no. Thanks though. I wanted to
go to the Met and drop this laundry
off and I need to deposit a check,
a whole...Sunday planned.
51 INT. LIVING ROOM. LATER 51
Frances eats a very large egg bagel very quickly. So
quickly that she nearly chokes. Her backpack is now off.
She notices how much faster she’s eating than everyone
else. Slows down. Or tries to.
NESSA
Why do you all live together?
FRANCES
Well, I knew Benji through Sophie
and -
BENJI
Where is Sophie these days?
FRANCES
Busy with work.
33.
BENJI (CONT'D)
NESSA
Which Sophie?
FRANCES
Sophie Kozak?
NESSA
Get out! I fucked her little
brother!
FRANCES
Oh, yeah, you fucked Thomas?
LEV
You fucked who?
NESSA
(to Frances)
How do you know her?
FRANCES
We went to college together and
we’re...we were born together.
NESSA
Oh you’re that Frances.
LEV
Who is Thomas?
FRANCES
Not really but that’s what we say.
(beat)
Yeah, I’m that Frances.
NESSA
You should know she speaks so
highly of you.
FRANCES
Right. I mean, we’re best friends.
She’s been to my house for
Christmas three times.
BENJI
Why doesn’t she go to her house?
FRANCES
(annoyed)
She’s Jewish.
NESSA
She was saying last week how much
she loves you.
34.
FRANCES
You saw her last week?
LEV
When did you fuck her brother?
FRANCES
Where were you guys?
NESSA
(to Lev)
I met you last night.
(then to Frances)
We were at that restaurant Po.
BENJI
Who were you fucking last week,
Lev?
FRANCES
What...is that a good restaurant?
Was she with...who was she with?
NESSA
Me and Thomas and that guy she
dates, Patch?
FRANCES
Double date.
NESSA
And some girl. Esme.
FRANCES
Phoebe. Cunt.
BENJI
Who were you fucking last week
Frances?
FRANCES
(joking)
I make love.
BENJI
Frances: UNDATEABLE!
Nessa is thinking about something. Puzzled.
NESSA
Yeah. Aren’t you a lot older than
Sophie?
35.
FRANCES
No. We went to college together.
NESSA
You seem older.
FRANCES
I’m a couple months older.
NESSA
You seem a LOT older. But less,
like, grown up. It’s weird. You
have an older face...
BENJI
...but like you don’t have your
shit together.
52 INT. LIVING ROOM. LATER. 52
Frances lays on the couch, shoes off. Benji still on the
computer. Lev is standing by the door, holding a
motorcycle helmet.
LEV
(a little sadly)
Nessa can’t come from sex. Only
sixty-nine.
FRANCES
That’s a crazy helmet.
LEV
Got to. Motorcycle law. Oh, can you
leave that rent check for me?
FRANCES
Yeah, yeah, sorry. I’ll put it on
your desk. It’s for...$950?
LEV
Nope. $1200.
FRANCES
I...I don’t, I thought we said $950
when I moved in.
LEV
Nope. The whole space is $4000 but
the little room is only $1200
FRANCES
But, I --
36.
BENJI
No, she’s right. We said she could
pay that much until she got more
cash together.
FRANCES
Remember because when I do the
Christmas show I’ll make more
because I’ll be doing like ten
shows a week...
LEV
Oh right right.
FRANCES
So we’re good with $950? That’s
okay? I’m really sorry...
He puts down his motorcycle visor.
LEV
No prob. Catch you on the
flipside!
Lev leaves.
FRANCES
He leaves so easily...
BENJI
Transportation is his thing. Bike,
skateboard. He has a car, too.
FRANCES
I can’t even get out of the house
on my feet!
She is quietly dejected.
FRANCES
You know what Virginia Woolf book
this reminds me of?
BENJI
Frances: UNDATEABLE.
Frances laughs.
BENJI
Wanna watch a movie?
FRANCES
Now?
37.
BENJI
Yeah, let’s do a movie afternoon.
FRANCES
I already wasted the whole day - I
already feel bad about the day.
BENJI
I think it’s a great day. I ate an
egg bagel that Lev’s slut made me.
I internet acquired three pairs of
very rare Ray Bans. I’m doing
awesome.
FRANCES
I thought we were both broke!
BENJI
I caved and finally took a loan
from my step dad. Bastard. I need a
fucking job, though.
FRANCES
What about SNL?
BENJI
Yeah, maybe. It’s gone so
downhill.
Goes to the bar. Looks at his watch. Pours himself a
scotch.
BENJI
Until then, it’s after three. I can
drink. Let’s do something fun. We
could go to a movie.
FRANCES
Movies are so expensive now...I
should be saving so I can pay full
rent.
BENJI
I’m not going to force you.
FRANCES
(getting up, ready)
I have to work out, at least. I
cannot get fat.
Frances puts on shoes, etc. Benji drinks his scotch and
starts going through his records to pick one.
38.
FRANCES
Do I look old to you?
BENJI
No. Yes. How old?
FRANCES
Older than I am? Older than twentyseven?
BENJI
No. Twenty-seven is old, though.
53 CUT TO: It’s dark out. Benji and Frances watch a movie. 53
Benji smokes and eats an egg roll. Frances wolfs down a
box of General Tso’s Chicken. She realizes she’s eating
too fast - tries to slow down.
54 INT. BOY’S APARTMENT. NEW DAY 54
Sophie looks at the stuff. Frances bobs next to her.
FRANCES
Isn’t this place AMAZING?
SOPHIE
Is that an Eames chair?
FRANCES
Yeah, isn’t this GREAT?!
SOPHIE
Total rich-kid apartment.
FRANCES
The boys just have good eyes. They
find stuff all the time.
SOPHIE
Do you know who Lev Shapiro’s dad
is?
FRANCES
He doesn’t get along with his
dad...Lev and Benji are artists.
SOPHIE
Exactly -- the only people who can
afford to be artists in New York
are rich.
FRANCES
I’m an artist. I’m not rich.
39.
SOPHIE
You are rare.
(beat)
It’s just this apartment is
very...aware of itself.
FRANCES
(defensively)
Everyone who comes here loves it. I
love it. The three of us are
hilarious together. We’re like a
sitcom. My Two Husbands.
SOPHIE
(softening)
No, that sounds great. I’m really
happy for you, Frances.
FRANCES
(a tad bitchy)
Thank you, Sophie.
Sophie sits beside her on the couch. Puts her head on
Frances’s shoulder.
Lev comes through the door.
LEV
Ladies!
FRANCES
Lev Shapiro! You know Sophie.
LEV
Of course. Still beautiful.
Kisses her hand. Sophie giggles. Frances looks thrilled.
LEV
How is the publishing business?
SOPHIE
You know. Not good. How’s
sculpture?
LEV
Amazing.
SOPHIE
Oh my boyfriend likes that artist
you work for...
40.
LEV
Tell your boyfriend he can always
talk to me if he wants to buy
something.
SOPHIE
I will.
FRANCES
(to herself)
Are we buying art now? Is that the
point we’re at?
LEV
I need to clean up. Ladies.
SOPHIE
Bye!
Lev retreats into his bedroom.
FRANCES
Lev would totally date you.
SOPHIE
I have a boyfriend.
FRANCES
But isn’t he charming? And so
handsome? You could be over here
all the time, it would be GREAT.
You wouldn’t have to spend all that
time with Phoebe.
SOPHIE
(laughs)
Right, I could fuck him just to not
hang out with Phoebe!
Lev walks across the living room in just a towel.
LEV
Don’t mind me. I’m just trying to
get your attention.
Lev goes into the bathroom. The shower turns on.
FRANCES
How could you not want to date him?
He’s kind of magic.
SOPHIE
Because I’m with Patch.
41.
FRANCES
Patch is the kind of guy who buys a
black leather couch and is like “I
love it.”
Sophie doesn’t react. Frances gets up. Starts trying to
do a headstand.
FRANCES
What are we doing with our day?
SOPHIE
I have to get going around five, so
I guess I should leave at --
FRANCES
I thought we were hanging out.
SOPHIE
We are.
FRANCES
All day.
SOPHIE
I have plans with Patch tonight. I
told you.
FRANCES
I don’t remember that.
SOPHIE
I texted that to you.
FRANCES
No you didn’t.
SOPHIE
Yes I did. Here --
Sophie gets out her phone, starts scrolling.
FRANCES
We’re not doing that. That’s
shitty. It’s not court.
SOPHIE
I did text you, though.
FRANCES
I believe you.
42.
SOPHIE
You don’t have to believe me, I did
text you.
She holds out her phone.
FRANCES
Do you want to see my room?
55 INT. FRANCES’S ROOM 55
Sophie and Frances in her room. They flop down on the
bed.
FRANCES
I kind of have a crush on this boy,
but his name is Georgie so I don’t
know how far it’s going to go.
SOPHIE
Can’t fuck a Georgie.
FRANCES
“I want you inside me Georgie.”
SOPHIE
Have you been dating anyone?
FRANCES
Nope.
SOPHIE
Oh, Frances.
FRANCES
It’s fine.
SOPHIE
What about Benji?
FRANCES
Benji thinks I’m undateable. It’s
really funny when he does it.
(indicating her and Sophie)
You and I are both undateable. Guys
can’t handle us. We are going to be
spinsters.
SOPHIE
Better break that to Patch.
43.
FRANCES
Boys are easier. Girls are passive
aggressive, boys are just like
“clean up your shit.”
SOPHIE
(looking around)
You’re still messy...
FRANCES
I’ve been busy.
SOPHIE
No, it wasn’t a criticism, I meant
it in a nice way. You will always
be messy and you will always look
at yourself too much in the mirror.
FRANCES
When do I look at myself in the
mirror?
SOPHIE
Always -- you just were doing it.
FRANCES
There are so many mirrors in this
apartment!
SOPHIE
I don’t want you to change. I like
your clothes everywhere and your
mirror thing -- it’s sweet.
FRANCES
You have stuff, too.
SOPHIE
What?
FRANCES
You judge people who aren’t as
moderate as you are.
SOPHIE
I do not.
FRANCES
Yes you do. And you don’t read.
Just then, Benji comes running into the room and leaps
into bed with them.
44.
BENJI
Hey bitches!
FRANCES
Oh my God, Benji! You’re crazy!
56 CUT TO: It’s night. Benji and Frances watch a movie. 56
FRANCES
(suddenly)
I wish we had cookies.
(pause)
I wish we had Chessmen.
The front door opens. Lev and a dark haired, long legged
girl enter. Different girl than Nessa.
LEV
Hey guys.
(to girl)
Wanna see my room?
They walk in front of the TV and into his room.
57 INT. THEATRE. NIGHT. 57
Frances performs in a piece with a troupe. She’s in the
back, but she’s in it. She is really, really dancing her
heart out. Very happy.
58 INT. DRESSING ROOM. NIGHT. 58
Frances is one of the last ones to get her stuff out.
Colleen comes in.
FRANCES
Sorry! I’m so slow! I have trouble
leaving places!
COLLEEN
You looked great tonight.
FRANCES
Thanks!
COLLEEN
Frances, I wanted to tell you so
you had some days to process it -
we won’t be able to use you in the
Christmas show. I’m really sorry.
FRANCES
What?
45.
COLLEEN
I’m really sorry -- you know what
bad shape the company is in.
FRANCES
(tearing up)
I know.
COLLEEN
(gently)
We can talk about next steps when
we’re back in February.
FRANCES
Am I fired?
COLLEEN
No! I just, I like you and I want
to talk to you about the future and
make sure it’s what you want.
FRANCES
I want to be in the company.
COLLEEN
I know.
Frances is crushed.
COLLEEN
Take your time.
FRANCES
Yeah. I will. I can’t help it.
59 INT. THEATRE. NIGHT. 59
Frances walks across the deserted stage. Takes a selfconsciously
sad moment.
60 INT. THEATRE LOBBY. NIGHT. MOMENTS LATER. 60
Most people are gone. A few stragglers remain.
Frances sees Sophie. Runs to her, hugs her.
FRANCES
(thrilled)
Oh, my love, I’m so glad you’re
here!
SOPHIE
You were great, really great.
46.
FRANCES
Could you see me?
SOPHIE
Yeah, we were on the risers, so we
could see to the back.
FRANCES
Who?
Patch walks up.
PATCH
Sorry, I had to take a leak.
Congratulations!
Frances face hardens.
FRANCES
Thank you.
Patch doesn’t pick up on anything.
PATCH
Should we all go out for a quick
drink?
FRANCES
A “quick” drink?
SOPHIE
We have to get up early tomorrow.
FRANCES
Tomorrow is Saturday.
PATCH
We have to catch a flight in the
morning -- we’re meeting my parents
in the Galapagos.
SOPHIE
(trying to connect to Frances)
I haven’t packed. You know me.
PATCH
Last Minute Mabel.
SOPHIE
Ronald Rule Follower.
They are doing a routine. He does this weird kind of
strangle motion and she acts like she’s getting
strangled. Frances just stares at them.
47.
61 INT. BAR. NIGHT. 61
Frances, Patch and Sophie sit in a corner. It’s kind of a
douche-y club/bar.
The waitress comes up.
SOPHIE
I’ll have a glass of --
FRANCES
-- We’ll get a bottle of your most
expensive vodka for the table. And
then all the stuff that comes with
it.
WAITRESS
Very good.
She leaves. Patch laughs and rubs his hands together
uncomfortably.
62 INT. BAR. NIGHT. LATER. 62
Frances is doing shots. Patch and Sophie sip on their
drinks.
FRANCES
(very drunk)
I want us to be a family, you know?
I can be part of your family, don’t
you think? Patch I love you. I want
to love you. But I need you to get
drunk.
The waitress comes back.
WAITRESS
How are we doing over here.
FRANCES
We’re good. Bring the check, we’ll
finish the bottle. Sophie?
SOPHIE
Yes.
FRANCES
Sophie come with me.
SOPHIE
Where?
48.
FRANCES
Bathroom.
SOPHIE
Really? Are we still doing this?
Frances is pulling Sophie away.
FRANCES
Patch, you got this?
PATCH
Um, yep.
63 INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT. 63
Frances and Sophie inside a stall together. Frances sits
on the toilet.
FRANCES
I was lying. I don’t love Patch.
SOPHIE
I do love him.
FRANCES
Since when? When did this happen?
SOPHIE
It’s been happening.
FRANCES
That’s fucking BULLSHIT. SOPHIE.
COME ON.
SOPHIE
No, you’re bullshit. And you’re
making me feel really bad right
now.
FRANCES
I want to love him if you love him
but you don’t love him.
SOPHIE
I DO.
FRANCES
(tearing up)
SOPHIE. I fucking held your head
when you cried I bought special
milk for you I know where you hide
your pills do not treat me like a
three hour brunch friend.
49.
SOPHIE
I’m not talking to you while you’re
like this.
Frances hits the wall close to Sophie’s head. It’s
violent and kind of scary.
64 INT. BAR. NIGHT. MOMENTS LATER. 64
Sophie two steps ahead of Frances, rushing back to the
table. She starts gathering her things. So does Frances.
SOPHIE
(to Patch)
We have to go.
FRANCES
I’m going.
PATCH
(to Sophie)
We can stay if you want.
FRANCES
I’M GOING.
SOPHIE
(to Patch)
C’mon, get your stuff.
Frances gets angry.
FRANCES
NO I’M GOING. YOU FUCKING SIT DOWN.
They sit.
FRANCES
(putting on a act)
Enjoy the Galapagos. I am also
going on a vacation. A long one.
I’ll set up my email so it sends
out a vacation email. And my
voicemail will also say I’m on
vacation. So if you get that,
Sophie, don’t worry, I’m on a
vacation. I’ll try to give you a
call when I get back, okay? Thanks,
guys. This was great.
Frances shoves the bottle of vodka into her purse and
takes off.
50.
65 INT. FRANCES ROOM. NIGHT. 65
The bottle of vodka that Frances took is sitting on her
dresser. All the lights are on. Frances is visibly
upset. She is putting away all the clothes in her room,
trying to straighten up, make a neatness.
She looks at herself in the mirror for one second,
catches herself doing it, and looks away.
Benji appears in the door watching her.
BENJI
You’re cleaning!
FRANCES
(defensively)
I’m not messy, I’m busy!
Benji is inside the room. He sits on the bed. Frances
looks at it, discouraged.
FRANCES
I don’t make my bed. Sophie always
made the bed.
She keeps cleaning.
FRANCES
I’m glad you’re home. I had a
shitty night.
BENJI
Sorry kid. I had a great night. I
cracked the second act of my
script. I’m on page 68.
FRANCES
That’s exciting. Is that for SNL?
BENJI
No, this is s sample script I’m
writing for the fourth Beverly
Hills Cop.
(smiles)
Boy trouble tonight?
FRANCES
Sophie trouble...
BENJI
Undateable.
51.
FRANCES
And I kind of, I don’t know, I got
temporarily fired.
BENJI
I’ve been fired like a million
times! It makes you cool!
FRANCES
(dejected)
Yeah. But without the Christmas
show, I can’t pay...
(then)
Do you have any good tunes?
BENJI
(clearly pleased)
Wait right there!
He gets his iPod and big headphones. He puts them on her.
BENJI
It’s a jammer.
FRANCES
(too loudly)
It’s great.
BENJI
I know.
He does that thing where he looks at her too intensely
while she’s listening, trying to figure out what part of
the song she’s on. She takes them off.
FRANCES
I love it. Put it on my mix.
He puts the headphones back on, wanting her to listen to
the song.
BENJI
Aren’t these headphones tits? I
just got them. They’re super-duper
noise cancelling. So I don’t have
to hear Lev fuck.
She takes them off again--
FRANCES
Ha.
--he tries to push them back on, she shoves them back to
him and goes back to cleaning.
52.
BENJI
Lev and I were talking about
getting a maid to come in once a
week.
FRANCES
A maid?
BENJI
Yeah, it’s not that expensive, like
$400 bucks a month?
Frances cleans drunkenly, thoughtfully.
FRANCES
Do you know that I’m actually poor?
BENJI
You aren’t poor. There are poor
people. You aren’t one of them.
FRANCES
Yes, but it’s, I mean, you’d feel
poor if you had as little money as
I do.
BENJI
But you’re not poor. That’s
offensive to actual poor people.
FRANCES
Yeah, I guess that’s true.
Frances keeps cleaning. Benji considers something.
BENJI
You want -- you want to hear
something hilarious?
FRANCES
Yes.
BENJI
Lev thinks we’re going to end up
married.
FRANCES
I’m too tall to marry.
BENJI
Ha! You are.
53.
FRANCES
That’s so funny. Why would he think
that?
BENJI
I did want to sleep with you when I
first met you.
(quickly)
But now - totally undateable!
FRANCES
I guess we are like a married
couple in a way. We talk. We don’t
have sex.
BENJI
Yeah. We get along super well.
FRANCES
Sophie and I used to be like that,
too.
BENJI
But Sophie was a girl. And you were
both straight. So it had less,
like, real world probability.
Frances yawns.
FRANCES
Right. Of course. Well. I’m done. I
hope I don’t have the spins when I
lay down.
BENJI
Just lay on your back by the edge
of the bed and put one foot on the
floor. It helps.
Frances nods. Benji reluctantly gets off the bed.
BENJI
Goodnight, then.
FRANCES
Night. Good luck with Beverly Hills
Cop.
BENJI
Four.
Benji walks towards the door.
54.
BENJI
Open? Shut?
FRANCES
Um, shut. I think. I don’t know.
Does it matter?
BENJI
I’ll leave it open so if you need
to throw up or cry or something you
can call me.
FRANCES
Thanks. Yeah. Open.
He’s gone. Frances sits down on the bed.
She looks towards the mirror and self-indulgently stares
at herself.
55.
PART THREE:
66 INT. STORAGE FACILITY. DAY. 66
The office is vaguely Christmas-y, maybe a wreath somewhere.
Frances walks down the hallway, a creepy long hallway with a
lot of people’s stuff behind metal.
She is carrying a chair.
67 EXT. STREET. DAY. 67
Frances stands on the corner with the chair. It’s cold out.
A student-looking person walks by. Frances approaches her
with the chair.
The student rejects the chair.
68 EXT. STREET. DAY. LATER 68
Frances sits on the chair and writes something on a piece of
card board. Gets up and puts the cardboard paper on it. It
reads:
Free Chair. Totally normal, really.
Didn’t fit in storage space. Needs
a home.
SACRAMENTO:
The following moments occur as silent scenes of a Sacramento
Christmas. The audio playing over all the shots in this
sequence is a conversation that Frances is having with her
mother while driving in a car around Sacramento. (Found

her, holding a dog.

Christmas. A tree in the window. Also all lit up.
71 INT. SACRAMENTO UNITARIAN UNIVERSALIST SOCIETY. DAY. 71
Frances and her parents attend a Sunday service at the
Unitarian Universalist Society. The UU Society is really more
like a multi-purpose cafeteria type of room with fold out
chairs and hippie-ish banners.
56.
Frances going around with her parents and shaking the hands
of older people she used to know.
72 EXT. SACRAMENTO. DAY. 72
Frances rides her bike through the streets of Sacramento.
73 INT. SACRAMENTO HOUSE. BATHROOM. DAY. 73
Frances lies in the tub, not moving, eyes closed. The
bathroom is decorated and kind of falling apart. The paint is
peeling around the sink, but all the towels match. Christmas
towels.
74 EXT. SACRAMENTO STREETS. NIGHT. 74
Frances and her parents walk along a special street in
Sacramento that has TONS of Christmas lights and decorations.
75 INT. SACRAMENTO HOUSE. DAY. 75
Christmas “dinner” - really late lunch: About twenty people
crammed around a table. The table doesn’t quite fit everyone
so there is a card table set up as an extension. Frances’ dad
is carving and serving. Frances gets happy drunk. There are
so many people and so much happiness that the windows fog up.
76 EXT. SACRAMENTO RIVER. DAY. 76
Frances’ and her Dad walk the dog on the levee along the
river.
77 EXT. SACRAMENTO HOUSE. DAY. 77

the way through security and onto the plane.
END SACRAMENTO MONTAGE.
57.
81 EXT. TOMPKINS SQUARE PARK. DAY 81
Frances is carrying a sleeping bag and a rolling suitcase and
her backpack.
RACHEL
Stop thanking me.
FRANCES
It just means a lot, letting me
stay with you-- I want you to know.
You will definitely be getting a
thank-you note. Remind me to get
your address in my e-mail.
RACHEL
Don’t worry.
FRANCES
It’s the only thing that’s forever.
E-mail.
They walk along in silence.
FRANCES
Hey! Have you ever done--where you
sing and--the other... It’s easier
to just do it, okay? You sing, make
up some songs about whatever, and
I’ll dance...
RACHEL
Why?
FRANCES
Oh for money, kind of, so if you
see someone then just shout “GIVE
ME YOUR MONEY!”
RACHEL
I don’t want to.
FRANCES
I’ll sing and you dance, if you
want.
RACHEL
We don’t need money like that.
FRANCES
It’s not for money. I think it’s
good to feel stupid sometimes. Did
you see that movie, Once?
58.
RACHEL
I’ve worked in homeless shelters
and it’s not funny to make fun of
people who have to beg and
panhandle.
FRANCES
Panhandle sounds old fashioned.
Rachel looks annoyed.
FRANCES
I’m not making fun. Just watch me
do it for a second.
Frances launches into singing and dancing while Rachel just
stands there. Someone walks by and Frances screams:
FRANCES
GIVE US YOUR MONEY.
RACHEL
(staring)
This is making me very
uncomfortable.
FRANCES
(suddenly stops)
It’s stupid. Sorry.
They walk along again in silence.
FRANCES
Do you want to put on really fancy
clothes and then go steal stuff
from Sephora?
Rachel says nothing.
FRANCES
Sorry about that. Thank you.
RACHEL
You’re welcome.
NADIA (V.O.)
Oh my God, she’s like the most
beautiful creature!
82 INT. SOME COUPLE’S APARTMENT. NIGHT. 82
CLOSE on a picture of a baby on an iPhone.
Nadia passes the iPhone to Spencer.
59.
SPENCER
Wow. That’s a healthy little girl.
It’s a six person dinner party. Spencer and Nadia, 30’s,
Janelle, and Andy, 40’s, Rachel and Frances.
Frances is under-dressed, wearing her jacket, backpack. She
awkwardly sits at the head of the table.
JANELLE
She’s in the 90 percentile for
height and 95 for weight.
ANDY
But it evens out later. When they
walk. It doesn’t mean she’ll be
fat.
Spencer hands it to Frances. She fiddles around on the
phone.
FRANCES
Oh, I think you’re getting a call.
She hands the phone to Andy who checks it and puts it in his
pocket.
FRANCES
It’s so funny when people have kids
and they’re all “I used to be so
focussed on ‘me’ and now I’m
totally not” - it’s like, NO! It’s
still you. It’s a mini you! It’s
a half you! I mean, you made it!
(eating too fast)
I forgot to eat today.
Pockets of conversation:
RACHEL
The only time you ever hear the
phrase “I’m not here to make
friends” is on reality television.
Andy starts to pour Frances wine. She puts her hand over the
glass, some splashing on her fingers.
ANDY
Oh...sorry.
FRANCES
I’m trying not to drink right now.
60.
ANDY
Oh, I’m sorry.
FRANCES
Don’t be sorry. You’re not the one
who’s bat-shit crazy after four
vodkas.
ANDY
Yeah...Nadia had a hard time giving
it up while she was pregnant.
FRANCES
What do you do?
ANDY
What?
FRANCES
“What do you do?” It’s such a
stupid question I thought I’d ask
it.
ANDY
Oh, I’m a lawyer. What do you do?
FRANCES
What a stupid question! Just
kidding...it’s, it’s hard to
explain.
ANDY
Because what you do is complicated?
FRANCES
No...because I don’t really do it?
Suddenly all conversation has stopped and everyone has turned
to Frances.
FRANCES
Well, I’m a dancer, I guess.
RACHEL
Frances and I are in the same
company.
FRANCES
But Rachel’s in the main company.
I’m an apprentice. Hopefully the *
touring company soon. *
(to Rachel)
I have a meeting with Colleen on
Monday morning.
Revision (05/14/2012) 61.
RACHEL
Cool.
FRANCES
(to the table, rambling)
But I’m doing really good. Rachel
and I have a really cool place. Or
Rachel does and I’m staying there
for six-ish weeks.
RACHEL *
Five. *
FRANCES *
Right. Five. I’ve been running a *
lot. I think I might be training
for the marathon.
RACHEL
Really?
People react positively: Oh! Cool!
FRANCES
But, yeah, everything is up in the
air. I like being alone. I just
got back from Sacramento.
RACHEL
Andy and Janelle just got back from
Paris.
JANELLE
Six and half hours on a plane with
a baby. Won’t be doing that again
soon! But it was heaven.
ANDY
(to Frances)
Do you ever get to Paris?
FRANCES
Not really. No. Kind of once.
Actually, no. What’s that museum
with the escalators in tubes?
ANDY
The Pompidou.
FRANCES
Yeah!
(beat)
Um, do you get there?
Revision (05/14/2012) 62.
RACHEL
They have a great place in the 6th.
ANDY
It’s a little pied a terre.
FRANCES
Literally!
ANDY
--but it’s a really special place.
JANELLE
It’s just been so hard to spend any
time there since I got the job at
the Journal.
(beat)
And the baby.
FRANCES
I’d love to go to Paris. I’ll bet
it’s magic. One of my friends from
college, Abby, who moved there
because her boyfriend works for a
bank. In school, she was on of the
top five friends, but then Zoe
became closer to our friend group
and Abby kind of moved to the outer
ring.
Everyone at the table listens politely. Rachel could give
two shits.
FRANCES
Sophie and Abby never totally got
along. She started dating Luke who
I always thought would have dated
any of us, but he ended up with
Abby.
Silence.
ANDY
Well, let me know if you’re ever
there, we like for it to be used.
FRANCES
Oh okay...I don’t see myself
probably getting there super soon,
but...thanks, thanks.
63.
SPENCER
Frances, I think you know one of my
colleagues at Goldman, Reade
“Patch” Krause. *
FRANCES
Oh, yeah, I know Patch! ‘Sup bra?
SPENCER
Mm. Yes, Patch knows more about *
South American currency stability *
than almost anyone else I know. *
FRANCES
His girlfriend Sophie and I are the *
same person with different hair. *
Not really. We went to college
together and took the train into
the city on weekends and made bad
decisions.
RACHEL
You got pregnant?
FRANCES
No. What? No!
NADIA
She’s a great lady. I really like
her. So smart.
FRANCES
Yeah. I mean, yeah. I mean, we’re
all smart.
NADIA
But she’s like book-smart, smart.
FRANCES
She’s actually not. She doesn’t
really read. I mean except for
work which is the funny thing.
NADIA
She seems like she reads a lot to
me.
FRANCES
I read way more.
NADIA
Uh huh.
Frances hesitates, hating herself in this conversation.
Revision (05/14/2012) 64.
FRANCES
I don’t know why I’m shit-talking
Sophie. She’s basically the best
person I know.
SPENCER
Crazy, though, right?
FRANCES
Yeah. Which thing?
SPENCER
Japan.
FRANCES
Japan?
SPENCER
They’re moving to Japan in a couple *
of weeks. *
FRANCES
What?
SPENCER
Patch got transferred. It’s a
really cool position. TK. *
FRANCES
For how long?
SPENCER
Indefinite.
FRANCES
But Sophie has a job at Random
House.
NADIA
She quit.
CLOSE on Frances’ face as it changes, pained and sad and
everything bad all at once. Conversation turns to other
things, travel plans, airlines, food.
Frances reaches for the wine and pours herself a steep glass.
CUT TO:
83 People have moved from the table and are now on the 83
terrace. Frances smokes. She’s drunk. She talks to
Nadia.
Revision (05/14/2012) 65.
FRANCES
Nadia, I want this one
moment...it’s what I want in a
relationship, which might explain
why I’m single now ha ha. It’s hard
to...it’s like that thing where you
are with someone and you love them
and they know it, and they love you
and you know it but it’s a party
and you’re both talking to other
people and laughing and shining and
you look across the room and catch
each other’s eye not because you
are possessive or that it’s
precisely sexual but because that
is your person in this life. And
it’s funny and sad, but only
because this life will end, and
it’s a secret world that no one
else knows about that exists right
there in public unnoticed - sort of
like how they say other dimensions
exist all around us but we don’t
have the ability to perceive them.
That’s...that’s what I want out of
a relationship. Or just life, I
guess. Love. Blah, I sound stoned.
I’m not stoned.
(suddenly)
Thanks for dinner. Bye!
NADIA
Oh...bye.
Frances grabs her backpack. Rachel catches her. *
RACHEL
Where the fuck are you going?
FRANCES
Oh, I’m kind of wasted. I was
going to go home. Is that okay?
RACHEL
I don’t care, I was just kidding.
FRANCES
(pause, to the group) *
Thanks for inviting me tonight. *
JANELLE *
Nice to have met you.
Revision (05/14/2012) 66.
SPENCER *
Lovely. *
FRANCES *
(suddenly)
Hey, Andy, actually, I think I
might be going to Paris this
weekend.
RACHEL
Really?
ANDY
Oh...
(pause)
Do you want to stay in our
apartment?
FRANCES
Yes.
ANDY
Okay. Wonderful. I’ll get you the
information.
FRANCES
Wonderful.
Rachel is staring at her oddly.
84 EXT. NEW YORK STREET. NIGHT. 84
Frances walks. It’s cold. Suddenly:
VOICE (O.S.)
Frances?!
Frances turns around. It’s Benji. With a girl.
FRANCES
BENJI!
BENJI
I knew it was you! Your weird man
walk.
FRANCES
(to the girl)
Hello.
BENJI
This is Caroline.
Revision (05/14/2012) 67.
CAROLINE
I’m Caroline.
BENJI
How are the dances, Frances?
Frances laughs.
BENJI *
(to Caroline) *
Frances and I used to be married. *
CAROLINE *
Cool. *
FRANCES
What are you guys doing? Want to
get a drink?
CAROLINE
We’re going to my friend’s party -
it’s a house party. I mean, that’s
the theme.
FRANCES
How is that a theme?
BENJI
Amazing, right?
CAROLINE
And it’s in an apartment.
(beat)
You can come with us. If you want.
Frances considers for a moment.
FRANCES
No...I really. I shouldn’t. I’m
going to Paris this weekend.
BENJI
Good for you, kid.
(probably lying)
I lived there for like a year.
CAROLINE
You never told me that.
BENJI
Yep. I was there when Serge *
Gainsbourg died. It was a crazy *
time? *
Revision (05/14/2012) 68.
CAROLINE *
In 1991? When you were eight? *
BENJI *
Yeah, it was the end of Euro-disco. *
FRANCES
I have so much to do. I think I’ll
read Proust because sometimes you
should do what you’re supposed to
do when you’re supposed to do it.
CAROLINE
Proust is pretty heavy.
FRANCES
Yeah, but it’s worth it, I hear.
CAROLINE
No, I mean the book. Carrying it
on the plane.
FRANCES
I should probably learn French
first and read it in French.
(beat)
Undateable!
CAROLINE
Mm.
Benji smiles warmly.
BENJI
Well, kid. We’ve got to run.
CAROLINE
Nice meeting you.
FRANCES
You, too. You’re very pretty.
CAROLINE
Thank you?
BENJI
See you around, weirdo.
He ruffles her hair. He and Caroline take each other’s hands
and walk off. Frances feels odd - not jealous, exactly, but
confused.
Revision (05/14/2012) 69.
85 INT. RACHEL’S APARTMENT. NIGHT 85
Frances is sitting in the dark, on Rachel’s computer,
concentrating. Key in the door, light on, Rachel walks in.
RACHEL
Is that my computer?
FRANCES
I’m sorry. Mine’s so old it doesn’t
have the wireless thing and Sophie
always had one that worked and -
RACHEL
- Yes, you can use it.
FRANCES
There are some good fares.
RACHEL
I thought you couldn’t pay me rent.
FRANCES
I can’t. I have no cash. I’m
putting in on this credit card I
got in the mail.
RACHEL
That’s not smart. That’s what they *
want. They want to keep you in
debt.
FRANCES
I know that. I see documentaries. *
Hey! Do you want to come?
RACHEL
I travel with the company, it’s
enough for me.
FRANCES
So today is, what? Wednesday...I
can go for a week! Oh no, shit. I
have that meeting with Colleen on
Monday.
RACHEL
Well...it’s not worth it.
FRANCES
Andy’s already emailed me the
information. And I took the
virtual tour of the apartment.
Revision (05/14/2012) 70.
FRANCES
(re: computer)
HEY LOOK! It’s perfect! The
cheapest one and I get back in time
for my meeting.
RACHEL
It’s still not worth it.
FRANCES
It’s meant to be!
RACHEL
What’s that about anyway?
FRANCES
I don’t know, but she’s never asked
me to have a meeting before...
Silence.
FRANCES
You never know what could happen.

71.
(MORE)
I’m here all of tomorrow. Call

goes through her bag and gets a pill. Takes it.
93F Light streams through the curtains. Frances sleeps like 93F
a rock.

FRANCES
Shit.
94 INT. SHOWER 94

small trickle.

Frances tries to brush her hair quickly and then gets hung up
on a zit on her face.

72.
FRANCES (CONT'D)
She leaves another message:
FRANCES
Do you guys want to meet for
dinner? I can meet you anywhere.
I’ll be the girl with the acne
holding more acne.
97 INT. CHAIN RESTAURANT 97
Frances eats something lame and disgusting. Her phone rings.
It’s a Blocked number. Frances practically lunges for it.
FRANCES
(breathless)
Hello?
SOPHIE
Frances?
FRANCES
(thrilled)
Sophie?! Oh my god, hi!
SOPHIE
(flat)
Hi.
FRANCES
(anticipatory)
Hi!
SOPHIE
I called you because I wanted to
tell you...that I’m moving to Japan
with Patch.
FRANCES
Oh... Is that good? Are you
excited?
SOPHIE
I know things are weird between us,
but we’re having a kind of going
away party tonight and I wanted to
say you’re invited.
FRANCES
Oh, yeah, I’m...I’m...I can’t.
SOPHIE
You don’t have to lie.
73.
FRANCES
(genuine)
No, I’m not lying. I’m not. That’s
really awesome about Japan.
SOPHIE
(softening)
It’s CRAZY. Last week, Patch’s boss
just called Patch into his office
and was like: Japan bitch!
FRANCES
I wish I could come tonight.
SOPHIE
(all the way back)
Me too.
FRANCES
We could get dinner next week?
SOPHIE
Ahhh! Why now! No, I want to but
Patch’s grandfather is real sick
and we’re all going to Chicago for *
these special treatments. Their
whole family goes. Being sick when
you’re rich is totally awesome.
They replace all his cells or
something. That can’t be right, but
that’s what it is in my mind.
FRANCES
Where are you so I can picture it?
SOPHIE
I’m in Patch’s study.
98 We CUT TO Sophie sitting in a leather chair at a desk. 98
FRANCES
I’ve never seen it. My picture’s
wrong.
SOPHIE
We’ll be coming back to New York a
lot, we’ll just be based in Tokyo.
FRANCES
You’ll learn Japanese.
SOPHIE
We can video chat. 21st century,
what up.
Revision (05/14/2012) 74.
FRANCES
My computer doesn’t have that.
SOPHIE
New places are good for you, I
think.
FRANCES
(observing the chain
restaurant around her)
Yeah.
SOPHIE
You should travel, Fran.
FRANCES
I am.
(lies for some reason)
I’m going to.
(nearly crying, genuine)
I’m happy for you, I just...no, you
know what? I’m just happy for you.
SOPHIE
We’re going to have a blog.
FRANCES
Together?
SOPHIE
Yeah, BARF. We’ll upload pictures
and stories and stuff.
FRANCES
Homeless and vacation have some
similarities.
SOPHIE
I’m so sorry I missed your
Christmas show...I guess I was mad.
FRANCES
-- it’s okay. I didn’t...it wasn’t
so good anyway.
SOPHIE
How’s all that going?
FRANCES
Um, pretty good. Great. I have a *
meeting on Monday with Colleen to
talk about stuff.
Revision (05/14/2012) 75.
SOPHIE *
You’ll finally be in the company? *
For real? *
FRANCES *
Yeah, I’ll probably be touring, *
though. *
SOPHIE *
That’s so great Fran. *
FRANCES *
(letting her assume) *
Yeah, it is. *
SOPHIE
Where are you living? I heard *
you’re not with the boys anymore.
Hey, you wanna live in our
apartment while we’re in Japan?
FRANCES
No. I. No.
(pause, deciding)
I’m going to have my own place real
soon.
SOPHIE
Maybe one day I’ll stay with you!
FRANCES
Maybe. Um, I should go.
(beat)
Thanks for calling, Sophie.
I’m...I’m sorry too.
SOPHIE
Apology accepted.
FRANCES
(bristling)
Well, don’t be a dick about it!
SOPHIE
I wasn’t!
FRANCES
I mean this phone call is costing
me a fortune!
SOPHIE
Why?
Revision (05/14/2012) 76.
FRANCES
(lying)
Just kidding. It isn’t. Hey, is
Abby in Paris now, do you know?
SOPHIE
I think so.
FRANCES
Okay.
SOPHIE
You sound really good Frances.
FRANCES
I am. I am really good. Thanks for
calling. I’m going to say something
but I’m going to hang up right
after because I don’t want you to
feel obligated to say something
back. I love you Sophie bye.
She hangs up hastily.

103 INT. AIRPLANE. NEXT DAY 103
Frances reads a fashion magazine.
104 INT. CAB FROM JFK. LATE DAY 104
Frances sits in the back. She looks exhausted. Her phone
suddenly lights up with a message. She listens.
77.
ABBY’S MESSAGE
Frances, honey, we just got your
messages, I don't know why they
didn't come through before. We're
here! We'd love to see you. This
is total kismet: You remember
Gerard, Nicholas's brother? The
one who looks like Jean Pierre
Leaud? Well, he's divorced now and
staying with us. I think you'd
really like him. Come to dinner
tonight, he'll be there, as well as
a philosopher and painter couple
who are really great... Oh, what
great timing.
Frances hangs up her phone.
105 INT. DANCE STUDIO. DAY. 105
Frances sits in a waiting area. She’s dressed in dance
clothes. Colleen pokes her head out of the office.
COLLEEN
Hey, you, come on in!
106 INT. COLLEEN’S OFFICE 106
Colleen moves behind her desk. Frances sits.
COLLEEN
Rachel said you were in Paris.
FRANCES
I was.
COLLEEN
You’re back so soon.
FRANCES
Well, we had our meeting.
COLLEEN
We could have moved it. I almost
cancelled it myself this morning--
I woke up with a tickle in my
throat.
Frances nods. Silence.
COLLEEN
Do you want to take over Nancy’s
position?
78.
FRANCES
What?
COLLEEN
Nancy’s pregnant.
FRANCES
Oh, no. I don’t. Who told you
that?
COLLEEN
No, I’m asking you. I mean, I
assumed you’re not keeping on with
the company.
Frances hesitates. It’s so hard to hear that.
COLLEEN
(sympathetic)
I know it’s hard, but it’s probably
best.
FRANCES
(not sure why she’s
agreeing)
Yeah.
COLLEEN
You don’t want to be an apprentice
for the rest of your life.
FRANCES
Nope.
COLLEEN
You know, you should think about
putting your own stuff together.
FRANCES
Like how?
COLLEEN
Like your own work.
FRANCES
Eh, I don’t know, I kind of stopped
doing it after college. And that
was basically, like, cheerleaders
doing my choreography.
COLLEEN
I always liked the stuff you did,
even for the kids.
79.
FRANCES
Yeah?
COLLEEN
Listen, you should think about
taking Nancy’s position. It’s not a
lot of money, but it’s enough to
keep you going...
FRANCES
Why would I do that?
COLLEEN
Just a good day job while you
figure out if you want to
choreograph or what.
FRANCES
You’re saying it like it’s easy.
COLLEEN
No, it’s not easy. But if you
worked here you could use the
studio space -
FRANCES
- I’ll get something else.
(lying)
I’m really close to getting
something.
COLLEEN
A job?
FRANCES
Yeah. Dancing. I’m still going to
be a dancer, just not here.
COLLEEN
Oh. Good for you. That’s great.
FRANCES
I know.
COLLEEN
Well, good luck Frances.
FRANCES
Yeah. Good luck to you, too.

Frances hikes. Alone. Breathing and walking. Lots of trees.
She gets to the top of something. Gets out her phone. Calls:
FRANCES
Hi Mom.
MOM
HI HONEY.
FRANCES
Hi Mom.
MOM
PAUL PICK UP THE OTHER PHONE. How
is it up there?
FRANCES
Good, good. I’m dancing - kind of -
...and I’m living in a dorm I never
got to live in before, which is
fun. All the RA’s live in dorms.
MOM
NOT THE ONE IN THE LIVING ROOM THE
BATTERY IS DEAD. Is it strange to
be back?
FRANCES
No - it’s kind of nice. It’s so
empty in the summer. It’s weird -
it’s like I went back to college *
but everyone was a dancer and not a *
semiotics major. *
MOM
That must be fun for you, though.
FRANCES
--and now I’m one of the adults...I
keep thinking I’m going to run into
Sophie.
DAD
(getting on the phone)
Hi honey!
Revision (05/14/2012) 81.
MOM
Sophie e-mailed me a picture of her
and Patch in the largest dog park
in the world - I think I’d really
like that about Japan.
FRANCES
I got a picture of them at a porn
mall.
MOM
Do you have enough money?
FRANCES
Yeah, I mean, I’m still in debt *
from Paris. That was just stupid.
MOM
I’m sorry we can’t help out.
FRANCES
You help out so much. I’ll be okay. *
They pay me extra to work the
events.
MOM
You aren’t a good waitress.
FRANCES
It’s not waitressing, it’s, like,
pouring. For donors.
DAD
Are you choreographing?
MOM
Paul, we went over this!
FRANCES
At least you can’t spend money in
nature.
MOM
Where are you right now?
FRANCES
Nature.
108 EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS. REGISTRATION. MORNING. 108
Frances is in a T-Shirt that says “ASK ME!” Another girl has
on the same T-Shirt.
Revision (05/14/2012) 82.
FRANCES
We don’t have to, like, guide them,
personally, do we?
GIRL
I think we just have to make sure
that they don’t fuck or die.
FRANCES
Ah. Good. Because I’m having a
Walden’s Pond moment.
GIRL
You have a pond?
FRANCES
You know I found something out
about Walden’s Pond - it was five
minutes from his mom’s house. He
would go over there and get
supplies.
GIRL
So where are you?
FRANCES
(confused)
Here?
GIRL
No, where do you go to college?
FRANCES
Oh, I’m not, I don’t go. I’m done
with college. But I went here...
(does a flourish)
--when I was younger.
GIRL
Weird! For some reason I thought
you HAD to be in college to do
this.
FRANCES
Nope...I just wanted to get out of
the city and I know the director of
the summer program, so she hooked
it up...and it had room and
board...and I’m working the events
to make more money.
GIRL
Wow, you’re super responsible.
83.
FRANCES
No. I’m not.
(pause)
It wasn’t that long ago that I went
here. I’m only twenty-seven.
The girl doesn’t care. Two young-ish looking dancers walk up
looking confused and carrying lots of luggage.
GIRL
Fuck. I don’t know any answers.
Don’t ask me!
109 INT. COLLEGE CAMPUS. DANCE STUDIO. AFTERNOON. 109
Frances walks in to the back of a class. It’s mostly collegeaged
students.
A Dance Teacher approaches Frances.
DANCE TEACHER
Are you with the program?
FRANCES
Yeah, I’m assisting.
DANCE TEACHER
Oh great, you’re one of the
teachers?
FRANCES
Um, no, not, I’m RAing and just -
but I’m a dancer -
DANCE TEACHER
- Oh, I’m so sorry.
FRANCES
What?
DANCE TEACHER
We can’t let Resident Assistants
take class.
FRANCES
But I’m not just an RA.
DANCE TEACHER
I’m so sorry, I don’t make the
rules.
FRANCES
I’m a dancer. And I went here.
84.
DANCE TEACHER
I’m so sorry, I have to start
class...
110 INT. COLLEGE CAMPUS. DANCE STUDIO. A LITTLE LATER. 110
Frances is watches the students taking the class that she was
not allowed to take. They’re really good. It’s

Frances caters, serving tiny food on big plates; pours wine
into empty glasses.
112 INT. FANCY PARTY. KITCHEN. NIGHT. 112
Frances is back in to get more food. A chef looks at her
suggestively:
CHEF
You’re a really good waitress.
FRANCES
I’m not a waitress. I just pour.
113 INT. LOCAL BAR. NIGHT. 113
Frances drinks with the catering people. It’s a college bar.
They are all wearing white shirts and black pants. They are
all younger than her.
MALE CATERER
Okay, I have one: Who do you have
to apologize to?
Everyone thinks.
MALE CATERER
I’ll go: Everyone I’ve talked shit
about over the past year.
People laugh.
FRANCES
I owe a bed and breakfast money...
FEMALE CATERER
No, that’s not the same.
85.
114 INT. DORM. NIGHT. 114
Frances walks into a dark dorm building. Stumbles towards her
room. A very annoyed looking girl is waiting for her there:
ANNOYED GIRL
(loud whisper)
You were supposed to be on duty ten
minutes ago!
FRANCES
(normal voice)
Sorry, I was -
ANNOYED GIRL
SHHHHHHHH!
Frances tiptoes around the other girl and into her room.
115 INT. DORM. FRANCES’ ROOM. NIGHT. 115
Frances flops down on her single bed. The room is totally
undecorated, a college dorm room in the summer. The weird
blonde wooden furniture.
116 INT. DORM. NIGHT. LATER. 116
Frances’ wakes up in the dark. She gets out of bed and walks
down the hallway. Goes to the bathroom. On the walk back to
her room, she sees a Younger Girl crying.
FRANCES
Are you okay?
YOUNGER GIRL
Yeah.
Frances hesitates. Then decides the girl needs someone:
FRANCES
(sitting down next to her)
I’m just going to sit here, okay?
YOUNGER GIRL
You don’t have to do that.
FRANCES
I’m just going to, though.
Frances sits and the Younger Girl cries.
86.
117 INT. COLLEGE STUDENT CENTER. COMPUTER BANK. DAY. 117
Frances stands at one of three computers, the other two are
taken. She checks her e-mail and looks at the joint Japan
blog that Sophie and Patch have.
A student looks on:
STUDENT
Are you going to study abroad
there?
FRANCES
Oh I’m not a student. There’s no *
more abroad. *
STUDENT
I’m half Japanese.
FRANCES
My best friend kind of lives there
now.
She drifts off. The student looks slightly annoyed.
STUDENT
(re: computer)
Are you done?
118 EXT. WOODS. DAY. 118
Frances smokes a cigarette. A campus security guard comes out
of the woods.
SECURITY GUARD
You can’t smoke here!
FRANCES
(dropping her cigarette)
Oh sorry --
SECURITY GUARD
-- No, don’t put it out! God damn
it!
They scuffle for the butt.
119 INT. COLLEGE RECEPTION ROOM. EVENING 119
The co-ordinater of the catering company is giving
assignments. He’s standing with Frances and pointing to the
back of a woman’s head at the party.
Revision (05/14/2012) 87.
FRANCES
Famous how?
CATERING BOSS
She’s a senator or a congresswoman
or something. She’s important.
FRANCES
I should read the news more.
CATERING BOSS
Your job tonight is to follow her.
Just make sure she’s taken care of.
She just gave the school a TON of
money. You don’t leave until she
leaves - got it?
120 INT. COLLEGE RECEPTION ROOM. EVENING 120
Frances, in her catering uniform, stands behind the
Congresswoman during the reception after the auction.
Frances gets the Congresswoman different drinks and foods,
always with her. The Congresswoman flirts with a Young Man.
Frances tries to not pay attention.
CONGRESSWOMAN
(sexily)
Well when I went here it was all *
girls. To meet a boy you had to *
take the “Fuck Truck” to Hoboken. *
FRANCES
(interrupting)
You went here? Excuse me. You went
to here?
CONGRESSWOMAN
Yes.
FRANCES
Oh my god, that makes so much
sense! I knew you looked familiar.
You were on the freakin’ brochures!
I’m Frances, I went here.
CONGRESSWOMAN
Nice to meet you, Frances.
FRANCES
You too! Sorry, sorry. I’m not
really supposed to talk to
you...I’m pouring. *
Revision (05/14/2012) 88.
CONGRESSWOMAN
Ah, yes.
FRANCES
(confidentially)
You’re very inspiring.
121 INT. COLLEGE RECEPTION ROOM. EVENING. LATER. 121
Frances stands behind the Congresswoman and the Very Young
Man. Holds a wine bottle.
Frances hears a girl crying and a man saying:
MAN VOICE (O.S.)
Don’t cry, baby, don’t cry, baby.
WOMAN VOICE (O.S.)
You don’t care!
MAN VOICE (O.S.)
I care.
WOMAN VOICE (O.S.)
You bought the CHEAPEST auction
thing. THE CHEAPEST.
MAN VOICE (O.S.)
I didn’t even go here!
Frances drifts in the direction of the fight. She turns a
corner:
It’s Sophie who’s crying. Patch consoling her. Frances can’t
believe it. Stares. Then retreats.
122 INT. COLLEGE RECEPTION ROOM. EVENING 122
Frances is trying to avoid being seen by Sophie and Patch.
Sophie walks straight up to the Congresswoman. Frances hides
behind her:
SOPHIE
(drunkenly)
You gave a GREAT speech, but I
seriously can’t believe you’re an
independent, because that’s
bullshit.
PATCH
(embarrassed)
Sorry. Sophie, let’s go. *
Revision (05/14/2012) 89.
SOPHIE
I went here. I thought you were
great. I made him give money.
CONGRESSWOMAN
Well, good. Nice to meet you.
SOPHIE
We live in Japan. So it’s like
crazy we’re here.
CONGRESSWOMAN
That’s wonderful that you came all
the way back for the auction.
SOPHIE
I WISH. No, we’re in New York for
a funeral. His grandpa. I wanted
to come here. He drove. But it
was MY idea.
CONGRESSWOMAN
Oh...I’m sorry for your loss.
SOPHIE
It’s okay. His grandpa had a
second family in Germany.
PATCH
(stern)
Sophie, let’s go.
SOPHIE
(to the Congresswoman)
I loved meeting you. A real honor.
(indicating Patch)
This douche is my affianced.
CONGRESSWOMAN
Ah.
PATCH
We’re engaged.
FRANCES
(from across the room)
YOU’RE ENGAGED?!
All eyes go to Frances.
123 INT. COLLEGE RECEPTION ROOM. EVENING 123
Sophie and Frances talk. Frances keeps pouring wine for the
Congresswoman. Sophie is messy drunk.
90.
SOPHIE
It’s not engaged engaged.
FRANCES
Right. What?
SOPHIE
We’re back for going to a funeral.
I would have called - but you’re
touring with the company.
FRANCES
(lying)
Yeah, I was, but you know, I needed
a break and I thought it would be
so funny to come back to the
college for the summer.
SOPHIE
It is funny! In a great way.
FRANCES
Yeah. And just making extra money
with this kind of gig.
SOPHIE
Yeah.
The Congresswoman continues to flirt with the Young Man.
SOPHIE
(a little too loudly)
What a slut.
FRANCES
Are you okay? Do you need some
food?
SOPHIE
(grabs a mini quiche)
I’ll just eat this.
FRANCES
I really didn’t expect to see you.
SOPHIE
Ditto.
FRANCES
It’s almost hard to be happy about
it because I didn’t have any time
to anticipate it.
91.
SOPHIE
(like in a bar trying to
pick up a girl)
Let’s get out of here.
FRANCES
I can’t. I have to shadow this
woman -- she’s my...ward.
The Congresswoman is full on making out with the Young Man.
124 EXT. COLLEGE RECEPTION ROOM. EVENING 124
The Congresswoman gets into her car with the Young Man.
Frances waits for the car door to close. She breaths a sigh
of relief.
Sophie and Patch are fighting as they get into their car.
SOPHIE
I’m not going back to New York. I
don’t want to go to the funeral
tomorrow.
PATCH
You have to go.
SOPHIE
I’m hanging out with Frances. We’re
going to the mall.
Frances climbs into the back seat.
125 INT. PATCH’S CAR. NIGHT. 125
Frances sits in the backseat. Patch drives and Sophie is in
the front seat. Sophie is still wasted:
SOPHIE
I’m bringing Frances to the
funeral.
FRANCES
(to Sophie)
I don’t want to go to the funeral.
SOPHIE
You didn’t even know your grandpa. *
You didn’t hang out.
PATCH
It’s a funeral. It doesn’t matter.
Revision (05/14/2012) 92.
SOPHIE
If you’re so broken up about it why
did we go to the auction tonight?
PATCH
BECAUSE YOU MADE ME GO.
SOPHIE
I DON’T EVEN WANT YOU HERE!
PATCH
You were wasted, I wasn’t going to
let you drive.
SOPHIE
(turning around)
Frances, what do you think?
FRANCES
About what?
PATCH
(to Frances)
You don’t need to answer.
SOPHIE
How sad were you really when your
Grandpa died?
FRANCES
Pretty sad. Yeah.
SOPHIE
(pause)
Well, I wasn’t.
(to Patch)
And I don’t see why you should be.
FRANCES
Oh, this is me, right up here. My
dorm.
Patch pulls up, Frances gets out. Patch and Sophie are still
fighting.
SOPHIE
(taking in her
environment)
“Chuggins.” We never lived in this *
dorm.
FRANCES
I know. It’s like the life I never
had! Anyway. Congratulations?
Revision (05/14/2012) 93.
(MORE)
On the engagement?
(pause)
And sorry for your loss.
SOPHIE
(to Patch)
You are so fucking selfish.
PATCH
Goodnight, Frances.
SOPHIE
Don’t talk to her, don’t look at
her. She’s my friend. She doesn’t
even like you.
FRANCES
I like you...
PATCH
(to Frances)
I like you too, Frances.
Patch pulls away. Frances’ face “what the fuck just
happened?”
126 INT. DORM ROOM. NIGHT. 126
Frances is asleep. She is woken up by an insistent knocking
at her door.
It’s Sophie. She’s crying.
FRANCES
Hey, hey, come in.
SOPHIE
Can I stay?
FRANCES
Of course. Come. Stay.
127 INT. DORM ROOM. NIGHT. LATER. 127
Sophie is sitting on the bed, alone. There is a tapping on
the door. She opens it. Frances is carrying two cups of tea.
FRANCES
It’s made in the microwave, but
it’s good.
SOPHIE
Thank you...I hope it’s okay I
borrowed lounge wear.
94.
FRANCES (CONT'D)
FRANCES
No, of course.
Sophie takes her tea and they both sit cross-legged on the
bed.
SOPHIE
(takes a sip of the tea,
looks green)
I think...
FRANCES
Oh, shit, here -
Frances puts a trashcan in front of her, Sophie throws up.
128 INT. DORM ROOM. NIGHT. LATER. 128
They lay side by side in a single bed. The bedside light is
on.
SOPHIE
I’m sorry I was so drunk I threw
up.
FRANCES
I’m sorry I live in a dorm with a
single bed.
Sophie laughs.
FRANCES
Here, lay on the outside.
SOPHIE
Okay.
They switch places.
FRANCES
Put one foot on the floor. It helps
you if you have the spins.
SOPHIE
I used to throw up all the time
when I was pregnant.
FRANCES
You were pregnant?
SOPHIE
In Japan. For a few weeks. Then I
miscarried which was cool.
95.
FRANCES
Wow.
SOPHIE
I mean, that sounds crass -
miscarriage is not cool.
FRANCES
Would you have had it?
SOPHIE
No.
FRANCES
Are you going to marry Patch?
SOPHIE
No.
FRANCES
I can’t believe that pregnant is no
longer crazy.
SOPHIE
I don’t want to stay in Tokyo. I
hate it there.
FRANCES
Really?
SOPHIE
Yeah. And then when I got pregnant
I was just like “get me the fuck
out.”
FRANCES
But your blog looks so happy.
SOPHIE
I don’t think my mom would read it
if it were about depression.
FRANCES
My mom would.
They laugh.
FRANCES *
I was telling the truth. I like *
Patch. I don’t hate him. *
SOPHIE *
I know. *
Revision (05/14/2012) 96.
FRANCES *
I’m sorry about...It’s just if *
something funny happens on the way *
to the deli, you’ll only tell one *
person and that will be Patch. And *
I’ll never hear about it. *
SOPHIE
(sort of taking it in, *
sort of not, after a *
beat) *
Fuck I’m tired.
Frances turns off the light.
FRANCES
It’s bedtime for all good children.
SOPHIE
I want to leave Patch and leave
Tokyo and come back to New York.
FRANCES
You should!
SOPHIE
I’m going to.
FRANCES
I could...I don’t know. I could
help you. I was going to say “you
could live with me,” but I don’t
have a home. Ha.
SOPHIE
I am going to do it.
FRANCES
Fuck yeah, girl.
SOPHIE
I miss my job. And I miss old
skyscrapers.
FRANCES
Maybe we’ll both move back to New
York at the same time. We’ll be
like women who re-discover
themselves after a divorce.
SOPHIE
That’s what my mom did.
Revision (05/14/2012) 97.
FRANCES
Oh, yeah, sorry.
SOPHIE
I think it will be great.
FRANCES
We should get apartments close to
each other - in Brooklyn.
SOPHIE
Yeah. That’s what we’ll do.
(pause)
I’ve always felt so competitive
with you.
FRANCES
(surprised)
Really? I don’t think I realized
we were competitive.
They are quiet for a minute.
SOPHIE
Fran?
FRANCES
Yes?
SOPHIE
Can you...I know it’s not my bed,
but...
FRANCES
What?
SOPHIE
Can you take off your socks?
FRANCES
Oh, yeah, sure.
SOPHIE
It’s just - socks in bed.
FRANCES
Right. Gross.
Frances takes off her socks and lies down again. Quiet.
SOPHIE
I love you Frances. Goodnight.
98.
FRANCES
I love you Sophie. Goodnight.
129 INT. DORM ROOM. MORNING. 129
Sophie is moving around the room quietly. Frances is still
sleeping.
After she finishes getting dressed, she writes a note.
CLOSE on the note as Sophie leaves.
Frances wakes up a second later. She looks around confused.
Sees the note. Reads it.
SOPHIE (V.O.)
I’m sorry I was so drunk last
night, but thank you for being nice
to me which I know you were even
though I don’t remember it. All I
know is you don’t have a trash can
this morning so it must have been
bad! Ha ha. I love you. I’ve got to
get back to this funeral in New
York. Call me when you’re awake! My
phone works in the states and there
aren’t any charges or anything.
xoxo Sophie
130 Without putting on shoes or a robe, Frances runs 130
downstairs and out to the parking lot in bare feet just to
see Patch’s car turning out of the lot and onto the main
road.
Frances runs after the car onto the road.
FRANCES
(calling)
Sophie! Sophie!
But Sophie doesn’t see or hear her. She’s gone. Frances looks
down at her bare feet and looks back up to the road.
BLACK.
99.
CODA
131 EXT. MANHATTAN STREET. DAY. 131
Frances walking with her backpack and bomber jacket early in
the morning. She’s carrying a coffee mug, like she made it at
home. Or at least thought ahead enough to bring it with her
and get it filled.
Gets out of the subway by City Hall. Walks through a hallway *
of dancers we’ve seen her in before - maybe she’s dancing? *
But nope. She’s -
132 INT. DANCE OFFICE. DAY. 132
Frances busily working at a development office. With Colleen *

133 EXT. PARK. DAY. 133 *
Frances choreographs something in the park during lunch. *
She’s enjoying herself.
Dances. Takes a bite of a sandwich that she produced from a
paper bag. She’s brought a bagged lunch. A female co-worker: *
CO-WORKER
We’re back in five, Frances. *
FRANCES
Thanks!
134 INT. DANCE OFFICE. DAY. 134
Frances is finishing up the day. People are leaving. She
looks at the clock. Makes a phone call:
FRANCES
Yes, hi, this is Frances...yes,
“Frances for tonight”...ha

check that we’re still on for me
bringing my guys in a little *
early...okay! Great! See you in
thirty!
135 EXT. SMALL THEATRE. EARLY EVENING 135
An older woman lets Frances into the space.
OLDER WOMAN
I think the other two groups will
be here by six forty five.
Revision (05/14/2012) 100.
FRANCES
We’ll be done by then, thanks!
Frances puts her stuff down and physically explores the
place.
136 INT. SMALL THEATRE. EARLY EVENING. 136
A lot of young dancers come in, all female, around twenty of
them. They all hug Frances, warm up, and run through a couple
of sequences.
Frances checks the lights and sound boards.
137 INT. SMALL THEATRE. EVENING. 137
One company finishes up. Come out and bow. Lights go down.
Frances is up in the sound/light booth. Trades places with
the person who was there before her.
She breathes hard, in and out, and turns the lights on and
the sound up.
Frances continues to run boards while her dancers perform.
There is a small audience. Frances is beaming.
138 INT. SMALL THEATRE. LOBBY. EVENING 138
People are milling around, talking with their families and
friends. It’s kind of a reception. It’s one of those things
where there was hardly anyone there who doesn’t know someone
who was performing.
Colleen is there, Rachel is there, Frances’ ex-boyfriend, Dan
is there, Lev and a different hot girl.
Benji approaches Frances.
BENJI
Hey, that was great.
FRANCES
Aw, thanks Ben. I like a lot of
ladies dancing.
BENJI
Yeah, at times it reminded me
of...Antonioni’s Zabriskie Point...
(beat)
Undateable.
FRANCES
Me?
101.
BENJI
No, I meant me that time.
FRANCES
Oh, yeah, Zabriskie Point.
BENJI
But also true. Meaning I’m not
dating anyone. Undateable. Same
difference.
FRANCES
Ah.
BENJI
Are you really, still, are you -
undateable?
FRANCES
You mean am I, oh, yes. Yes I am.
Very undateable.
Benji and Frances have a half-moment.
Frances greets more people, takes pictures, laughs. Colleen
is there, congratulates her. This is the high point of
Frances’ twenty-seven years.
Then, across the room, Frances sees Sophie. At first Sophie
doesn’t see her. Patch enters frame and puts his arm around
her. She holds up her hand to someone. She has a ring.
RACHEL
You guys got married!
Frances looks away, surveys the crowd of people who came to
see her show. She smiles. She looks back. Sophie is
watching her.
They catch each other’s eye and kind of smile.
It’s the moment that Frances has always wanted. They are
sharing a life-long inside joke.
COLLEEN (O.S.)
Who are you making eyes at?
FRANCES
That’s Sophie. She’s my best
friend.
They keep looking at each other, kind of laughing, kind of
emotional. No one breaks.
102.
CLOSE on Sophie looking at Frances.
CLOSE on Frances looking on Sophie.
139 EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING. BROOKLYN. MORNING 139
Nothing special.
140 INT. BRAND NEW APARTMENT. MORNING 140
CLOSE on Frances’ hand writing something. It’s her name.
Frances cuts out the name from the sheet of paper. She’s
sitting at the kitchen table of a small just-moved-into
pretty empty apartment.
141 She walks out and trots down a flight of stairs to a bank 141
of mailboxes. She finds 2B and opens it.
CLOSE on Frances sliding the piece of paper into the mail
slot. It doesn’t quite fit. She has to fold it to get it
into the space. Once it is in, it just reads:
FRANCES HA
We hold on the title.
Roll CREDITS over the image.
