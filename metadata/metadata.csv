The sounds of fill the car. As they pull out, Michael crosses in front of them on his moped. Kat has to the brakes to keep from hitting him (yelling) Remove head from sphincter! Then pedal! Michael begins fearfully, pedaling as Kat out, angry at the delay. Cameron rushes over You all right? He slows to a stop Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew. That's her? Bianca's sister? The mewling, rampalian wretch herself. Michael putters off, leaving Cameron dodging Patrick's grimy, grey Jeep -- a vehicle several years and many paint jobs away from its former glory as a - - as he sideswipes several cars on his way out of the lot. . - , attractive and focused, sits in front of her computer, typing quickly. shelf next to her holds several bodice-ripper romance novels, bearing her name.

He grabs the mail and rifles through it, as he bends down to kiss Sharon on the cheek. In the microwave. (to Kat) Make anyone cry today? Sadly, no. But it's only four-thirty. Bianca walks in. (continuing) Where've you been? (eyeing Walter) Nowhere... Hi, Daddy. She kisses him on the cheek Hello, precious. Walter kisses Bianca back as Kat heads up the stairs How touching. Walter holds up a letter to Kat What's this? It says Sarah Lawrence? Snatches it away from him. guess got in Sharon looks up from her computer. What's a synonym for throbbing? Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country. know. thought we decided you were going to school here. At of 0. You decided. Is there even a question that we want her to stay? Kat gives Bianca an evil look then smiles sweetly at Ask Bianca who drove her home Swollen...turgid. (to Bianca; upset) Who drove you home? Bianca glares at Kat then turns to Walter Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and think he might ask... No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating. End of discussion. What if she never starts dating? Then neither will you. And 'll get to sleep at night. But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy! This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips? Enough! He pulls out a small tape recorder from his black bag. (continuing) Do you know what this is? He hits the ""play' button and emanate from the tape recorder. (in unison, by rote) The sound of a fifteen-year-old in labor. This is why you're not dating until your sister does. But she doesn't want to date. Exactly my point His goes off and he grabs his bag again (continuing) Jesus! Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating? Tumescent! (to Sharon; as he leaves) You're not helping. . - Cameron sits with an empty chair beside him. Bianca arrives in a flurry of blonde hair. Can we make this quick? Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad. Again. Well, thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you. Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part. Please. (looking down) Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine. Saturday? Night? Bianca smiles slowly You're asking me out. That's so cute. What's your name again? (embarrassed) Forget it. Bianca seizes an opportunity. No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction --- Cameron. The thing is, Cameron -- 'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser. My sister. can't date until she does. Seems like she could get a date easy enough... She fingers a lock of her hair. He looks on, dazzled. The problem is, she's completely anti-social. Why? Unsolved mystery. She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something. That's a shame. She reaches out and touches his arm Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend... Let me see what can do. Cameron smiles, having no idea how stupid he is . frog is being torn asunder by several prongs and picks. Michael and Cameron go for the spleen. You're in school for one day and you ask out the most beautiful girl? Do you have no concept of the high school social code? Cameron grins away teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me. Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you. So what's the point? Cameron motions with his head toward Patrick, a few lab tables away. He's wearing biker glasses instead of goggles as he tries to revive his frog. What about him? (confused) You wanna go out with him? The others at the lab table raise their eyebrows (impatient) No - he could wrangle with the sister. Michael smiles. Liking the intrigue. What makes you think he'll do it? He seems like he thrives on danger No kidding. He's a criminal. heard he lit a state trooper on fire. He just got out of Alcatraz... They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology? 'm serious, man, he's whacked. He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers. Forget his reputation. Do you think we've got a plan or not? Did she actually say she'd go out with you? That's what just said Michael processes this. You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set. You'd outrank everyone. Strictly -list. With me by your side. thought you hated those people. Hey -- 've gotta have a few clients when get to Wall Street. cowboy flicks the frog's heart into one of the Coffee Kid's latte. Cameron presses on, over the melee. So now all we gotta do is talk to him. He points to Patrick, who now makes his frog hump another frog, with full-on sound effects. 'll let you handle that. . - Boys and a few stray girls nail their pieces of wood Michael sits next to , a Coffee Kid, who holds out his jacket like the men who sell watches in the subway. Inside several bags of coffee hang from hooks. Some people like the Colombian, but it all depends on your acidity preference. Me? prefer East African and Indonesian. You start the day with a Sumatra Boengie or maybe and Ethiopian Sidamo in your cup, you're that much farther ahead than someone drinkin' Cosia Rican or Kona -- you know what mean? Michael nods solemnly. Patrick sits at a table with Scurvy, making something that looks like a machete out of a two-by-four. Cameron approaches, full of good-natured farm boy cheer Hey, there In response, Patrick brandishes a loud in his direction. Cameron slinks away. (continuing) Later, then. Michael watches, shaking his head. . - Joey and his pals take turns drawing boobs onto a cafeteria tray with a magic marker. Michael walks up and sits between them, casual as can be Hey. Are you lost? Nope - just came by to chat We don't chat. Well, actually, thought 'd run an idea by you. You know, just to see if you're interested. We're not. He grabs Michael by the side of the head, and proceeds to draw a penis on his cheek with the magic marker. Michael suffers the indignity and speaks undaunted. (grimacing) Hear me out. You want Bianca don't you? Joey sits back and cackles at his drawing. (continuing) But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right? Does this conversation have a purpose? So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her. Someone who's up for the job. Michael points to Patrick, who makes a disgusted face at his turkey pot pie before he rises and throws it at the garbage can, rather than in it. That guy? heard he ate a live duck once. Everything but the beak and the feet. Exactly Joey turns to look at Michael. What's in it for you? Oh, hey, nothin' man Purely good will on my part. He rises to leave and turns to the others. (continuing) have a dick on my face, don't ? . ' - Michael stands at the sink, trying to scrub Joey's artwork off his face as Cameron watches. You got him involved? Like we had a choice? Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca. Cameron grins and puts an arm around him You're one brilliant guy Michael pulls back, noticing other guys filing in. Hey - appreciate gratitude as much as the next guy, but it's not gonna do you any good to be known as New Kid Who Embraces Guys In The Bathroom. Cameron pulls back and attempts to posture himself in a manly way for the others, now watching. . ' - Kat and Mandella pick apart their pad thai. Mandella is smoking. So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. have no say at all. William would never have gone to a state school. William didn't even go to high school That's never been proven Neither has his heterosexuality. Mandella replies with a look of ice. Kat uses the moment to stub out Mandella's cigarette. (continuing) appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but 'm consuming. (pointing at her food) Do you mind? Does it matter? If was Bianca, it would be, ""Any school you want, precious. Don't forget your tiara."" They both look up as Patrick enters. He walks up to the counter to place his order. Mandella leans toward Kat with the glow of fresh gossip Janice Parker told me he was a roadie for Marilyn Manson. Patrick nods at them as he takes his food outside. Janice Parker is an idiot . ' - Patrick sits before Miss Perky, eating his Thai food (looking at chart) don't understand, Patrick. You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well? Touch of the flu. 'm at a loss, then. What should we talk about? Your year of absence? He smiles his charming smile How 'bout your sex life? She tolerates his comment with her withering glance. Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid? What's to discuss? You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up? Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good... The bell . Fine. Go do something repugnant and give us something to talk about next week. . - Several pairs of tutors and students sit at the various desks. Mandella sits with , a White Rasta. She attempts to get him to do geometry, but he stares at her, as if smitten Look, it's really easy. You're a freedom fighter. Be proud, sister. Mandella sets down her pencil and closes the book. (rotely) It's Mandella with two 's. am not related to Nelson Mandela. am not a political figure. do not live in South Africa. My parents just spent a few too many acid trips thinking they were revolutionaries. But you freed our people Your ""people"" are white, suburban high school boys who smoke too much hemp. have not freed you, Trevor. (grabbing his arm dramatically) Only you can free yourself. Bianca and Cameron sit side by side, cozy as can be 'esc ma tete. This is my head Right. See? You're ready for the quiz. don't want to know how to say that though. want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are. How much does champagne cost? Stuff like Chat. have never in my life had to point out my head to someone. That's because it's such a nice one. Forget French. She shuts her book and puts on a seductive smile (continuing) How is our little Find the Wench Date plan progressing? Well, there's someone think might be -- Bianca's eyes light up Show me . - Cameron and Bianca lean against the wall -inconspicuously. Bianca plays it cool. Give me a sign when he walks by. And don't point. The bell . Kids flood past. Then Patrick saunters by with Scurvy. Cameron nudges Bianca. There. Where? Out of desperation, Cameron awkwardly lunges across Patrick's path. Patrick shoves him back against the wall without a thought. Cameron lands in a at Bianca's feet. guess he didn't see me (calling after Patrick) Some other time -- Bianca watches Patrick, a wicked gleam in her eye. My God, he's repulsive. He's so perfect! . - Several volleyball games are being played. Joey and a member of his hulking entourage, approach Patrick, who still manages to look cool, even in gym clothes. They pull him aside roughly. (shrugging them off) What? Joey points See that girl? Patrick follows his line of vision to Kat as she spikes the ball into some poor cowboy's face. Yeah What do you think? Kat wins the game and high fives the others, who are scared of her. Two legs, nice rack... Yeah, whatever. want you to go out with her. Sure, Sparky. 'll get right on it. You just said You need money to take a girl out But you'd go out with her if you had the cake? Patrick stares at Joey deadpan. His dislike for the guy obvious. (sarcastic) Yeah, 'd take her to Europe if had the plane. Joey smiles. You got it, Verona. pick up the tab, you do the honors. You're gonna pay me to take out some girl? can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend. And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend. How much? Twenty bucks each time you take her out. can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks. Fine, thirty. Patrick raises an eyebrow, urging him up (continuing) Take it or leave it. This isn't a negotiation. Fifty, and you've got your man. Patrick walks away with a smile . - Kat and the rest of the team go through a grueling practice session. Kat spares no one as she whips the ball all over the field. Patrick sits on the bleachers nearby, watching. cigarette dangles from his mouth. His pal, is next to him. . , the coach, blows the . . (proudly) Good run, Stratford. Kat nods in response, and the girls leave the field. Patrick hops down to follow. Hey. Girlie. Kat stops and turns slowly to look at him. (continuing) mean Wo-man. How ya doin'? (smiles brightly) Sweating like a pig, actually. And yourself? There's a way to get a guy's attention. My mission in life. She stands there undaunted, hand on hip.

Friday. backs up a little. He uses his most seductive tone The night take you to places you've never been before. And back. Like where? The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy? know a lot more than that Kat stares at him. Doubtful. Very doubtful. She walks away quickly, leaving him standing alone. (calling after her) You're no bargain either, sweetheart. Scurvy appears at his side So guess the Jeep won't be getting a new Blaupunkt. Cameron and Michael watch. He took the bait. / - Kat washes her face at the sink. Bianca appears behind her, and attempts to twist Kat's hair into a chignon. She wacks Bianca away. Have you ever considered a new look? mean, seriously, you could have some potential buried under all this hostility. Kat pushes past her into the hallway. have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way. Can you at least start wearing a bra? Kat her door in response. . - Patrick, Scurvy and some other randoms head for the exit You up for a burger? Patrick looks in his wallet. It's empty. . - Kat stands at her locker, gathering her books. Patrick appears at her side, smiling. Hey Kat doesn't answer (continuing) You hate me don't you? don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion. Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me. And why would do that? Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass... You -- covered in my vomit. Seven-thirty? She slams her locker shut and walks away . - Kat emerges from a music store carrying a bag of CDs in her teeth, and fumbling through her purse with both hands.

Are you following me? was in the laundromat. saw your car. Thought 'd say hi. Hi She gets in and starts the car. You're not a big talker, are you? Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy. She starts to pull out, and is blocked by Joey's Viper, which pulls up perpendicular to her rear and parks. Joey and his groupies emerge and head for the liquor store (continuing) Hey -- do you mind? Not at all They continue on into the store. Kat stares at them in disbelief... Then Her vintage fenders into the door of Joey's precious Viper. Patrick watches with a delighted grin Joey races out of the liquor store. (continuing) You fucking bitch!

Joey sees through the bluff Let me put it to you this way, if you don't get any action, don't get any action. So get your ass on hers by the end of the week. Joey starts to walk off just upped my price (turning) What? hundred bucks a date. Forget it. Forget her sister, then. Joey thinks for a frustrated moment, the locker, then peels another fifty out of his wallet with a menacing scowl. You better hope you're as smooth as you think you are, Verona. Patrick takes the money with a smile. . - Cameron runs a sentence past Bianca. La copine et 'ami? La diferance? Bianca glares at him. ""copine"" is someone you can count on. An ""ami"" is someone who makes promises he can't keep. Cameron closes the French book You got something on your mind? counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date? He melts You have my word. As a gentleman You're sweet. She touches his hand. He blushes at her praise and watches her toss her hair back (appreciative) How do you get your hair to look like that? Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment. Cameron nods with interest. You know, read an article about that. Bianca looks surprised. You did? .

The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford. What is it with this chick? She have three tits? Cameron starts to object, but Michael holds up a hand. think speak correctly when say that Cameron's love is pure. Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's. Dorsey can plow whoever he wants.

Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture. Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl. Patrick smiles. He likes the idea of Joey being a pawn in this game. You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast? (grinning) We're your guys. And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way. Yeah -- we'll see.

(pouting) really, really, really wanna go, but can't. Not unless my sister goes. 'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him. He fishes. (continuing) She's not a... Lesbian? No. found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so 'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies. So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones? Who knows?

We'd like two for Gigglepuss! Bruce looks the girls up and down. can count. He looks at their IDs. Mandella gently moves Kat aside, wearing a face that could only be described as "" a Victoria's Secret model."" 'll bet you can.. She sticks out her chest and licks her lips.

We're Gigglepuss and we're from Olympia. teenage boy in the audience takes the opportunity to scream. (0..) Pet my kitty! Meow They rev into their next song. Mandella and Kat glow with sweat. When they hear the opening chords of the song, they look at each other and scream with glee as they begin to dance. They couldn't be having a better time. Patrick signals to get the bartender's attention and looks across the bouncing surge of the crowd. He spots Kat and Mandella singing along. The gleeful Kat -- dancing and looking completely at ease. None of her usual ""attitude"". Patrick is transfixed. And most definitely attracted. Kat looks at Mandella. (shouting) need agua! She makes her way through the crowd to the bar. She made it. She signals for the bartender and as she's waiting, looks around. She spots Patrick a few feet away (continuing to herself) Shit She sneaks a glance. He's staring, but this time he looks away before she can. Despite herself, she's miffed. The bartender arrives (shouting) What can get you? Two waters. She looks at Patrick again. He's completely absorbed in the band. She scowls. The bottled water arrives and she marches off, forgetting to pay. She walks up to Patrick. (continuing) You're not fooling anyone. Patrick looks at her, surprised (yelling) hey. Great show, huh? (yelling) If you're planning on asking me out you might as well get it over with. (yelling) Excuse me? (yelling) That's what you want, isn't it? (yelling; gesturing toward the band) Do you mind? You're sort of ruining it for me. Kat steams. And watches him watch the band (yelling) You're not surrounded by your usual cloud of smoke. The band takes a break, so they can stop yelling now know. quit. He leans back, making no attempt to hit on her. She moves closer. Oh, really? He motions toward the stage You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there. You know who The Raincoats are? Why, don't you? She's completely taken aback. He uses the moment to his advantage and brushes her hair back as he speaks right into her ear. (continuing) watched you out there 've never seen you look like that Kat steps away, brushing the hair back that he just touched Her cheeks pinken. His cocky side is back in a flash (continuing) Come to that party with me. At that moment, the band starts another (yelling) What? The bartender approaches. (to Kat, yelling) You forgot to pay! (yelling) got it, Rick. He tosses some bills on the bar Rather than thank him, Kat simply watches him, trying to figure out his motive. (continuing; yelling) Nine-thirty then. few people have gotten between them at the bar and she can't hear a word he's saying. She gives him one last look and heads back into the crowd. Patrick smiles. She didn't say no this time. . - The crowd files out of the club, Kat and Mandella amongst them. ^ they're walking toward the parking lot, Patrick coasts by in his truck. The gears . He yells out the window. What'd he say? Who cares? Mandella watches Kat as she stares after Patrick Has he importun'd you with love in honourable fashion? Kat glances sharply at her. (continuing; off her look) Don't be Cruella with me. 'm in favor of romance. You're the one that wants to march on Washington every five minutes. Kat pokes her, then looks back at the club dreamily. Gigglepuss was so beyond. Mandella nods. They were. only wish William could have been here to witness the rebirth of punk rock with us. Kat links her arm through Mandella's and they head for the car. So true. . - Cameron and Michael are at Michael's locker. So, then she says that she almost didn't wear the Kenneth Coles with that dress because she thought she was mixing, you know, genres.

Hell, 've just been going over the whole thing in my head and - Joey appears over Cameron's shoulder. Hey. Dingo Boingo Cameron and Michael look at each other And turn around slowly (continuing; to Michael) hear you're helpin' Verona. Uh, yeah. We're old friend* You and Verona? What?

Wait -- was that?-- Did your hairline just recede? He panics, whipping out a handy pocket mirror She's already walking away. Where ya goin? Away. Your sister here?

She giggles as he picks her up and carries her off -- just as Cameron returns, a beer -- complete with a napkin and straw -- in his hand. Chastity glares with a jealous fury after Bianca and Joey, then gives Cameron the once-over and walks away. Michael appears. Extremely unfortunate maneuver. The hell is that? What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her? Buttholus extremus. But hey, you're making progress. No, ' m not.

Who needs affection when 've got blind hatred? Just let me sit down. He walks her over to the swingset and plops her down in a swing, moving her hands to hang onto the chains. How's that? She sits and looks at him for a moment with a smile. Then over backward. (continuing) Jesus. You're like a weeble Patrick rushes to right her, then starts pushing her on the swing to keep her entertained. (continuing) Why'd you let him get to you? Who? Dorsey. hate him. know.

She looks at her watch. have to be home in twenty minutes. (eagerly, to Joey) don't have to be home 'til two. Then, c'mon. (to Bianca) Maybe next time -- They head back into the party, leaving an astonished Bianca Cameron exits the party and stops when he sees Bianca standing alone. (slightly accusatory) Have fun tonight? Tons He starts to walk on (continuing) Cameron? He stops. She gives him a helpless smile. (continuing) Do you think you could give me a ride home? . ' - Patrick drives as Kat sits in the passenger seat, fiddling with the radio dial. She finds a she's happy with and Patrick quickly changes it. 'm driving, so get to pick the tunes.

Patrick doesn't have an answer for this, so he let's her listen to her song. (continuing) When you were gone last year -- where were you? Busy Were you in jail? Maybe. No, you weren't Then why'd you ask? Why'd you lie? He doesn't answer, but instead, frowns and turns up the music. She bobs her head drunkenly. (continuing) should do this. Do what? This. She points to the radio Start a band? (sarcastically) My father wouldn't approve of that that You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission. She turns to look at him. Oh, so now you think you know me? 'm gettin' there Her voice loses it's venom The only thing people know about me is that 'm ""scary"". He turns to look at her -- she looks anything but scary right now. He tries to hide his smile. Yeah -- well, 'm no picnic myself. They eye each other, sharing a moment of connection, realizing they're both created the same exterior for themselves. Patrick pulls into her driveway and shuts off the motor. He looks up at her house. (continuing) So what ' s up with your dad? He a pain in the ass? He just wants me to be someone 'm not. Who? No offense, but you're sister is without. know everyone likes her and all, but ... Kat stares at him with new admiration. You know -- you're not as vile as thought you were.

But You always been this selfish? thinks a minute He pulls up in front of the house Just because you're beautiful, doesn't mean you can treat people like they don't matter. She looks at him for a moment -- then grabs his face and gives him a kiss on the lips. He draws back in surprise, then kisses her back. She smiles, then gets out of the car without another word. Cameron grins and drives away (continuing) And 'm back in the saddle. . - Kat sits at her desk, burying her face in a book as the others enter. The White Rastas are first.

(to Kat) Dance for me, cowgirl. He sits next to Derek (continuing) Okay, now tell me again why he didn't shoot the deputy? Because the deputy meant him no harm, my friend. It was only the sheriff that was the oppressor. Joey saunters in and takes his seat. Kat, babe, you were on fire. Mrs. Blaise enters and sits at her desk . Well now, did everyone have a good weekend? Maybe we should ask Verona Patrick enters, late, and slinks to his desk. Kat looks up, down and around, everywhere but at Patrick. Mrs. Blaise tries to remember what she's supposed to talk about. . Okay then. Well. (beat) Oh, yes She clears her throat. . (continuing) 'd like you all to write your own version of Shakespeare's Sonnet #141. Groans. . (continuing) Any form you'd like. Rhyme, no rhyme, whatever. 'd like to see you elaborate on his theme, however. Let's read it aloud, shall we? Anyone? The class is frozen in apathy. . (continuing) Derek? Ms. Blaise hands him the sonnet. He shifts uncomfortably in his seat. Then grins. (reading; in his Rasta stoner drawl) In faith, do not love thee with mine eyes/ For they in thee a thousand errors note/ But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise/ Who in despite of view is pleas 'd to dote. In the back of the room Clem raises his hand Ms. Blaise, can get the bathroom pass? Damn if Shakespeare don't act as a laxative on my person. . ' - Kat and Mandella scrape the peanuts out of their sauce. You went to the party? thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity. didn't have a choice. You didn't have a choice?

She won't even look at me Why can't you just tell her you're sorry? Patrick's expression says that this is not a possibility. Michael makes a time out sign with his hands. 'm on it . - Mandella is at her locker. Drawings of William Shakespeare adorn the door. She looks at them with a sigh, then ties her silk scarf tightly around her neck, in an attempt to cut off her air supply. Michael walks up. Hey there. Tired of breathing? (shyly, as she loosens the scarf) Hi. Cool pictures. You a fan? Yeah. guess. rocks. Very hip. You think? Oh yeah. She looks at him suspiciously Who could refrain that had a heart to love and in that heart, courage to make ' love known? Michael thinks for a minute. Macbeth, right? (happily stunned) Right.

So what did have an effect on ? Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing. She pushes past him and heads out the' door Pat looks down at the book he's been holding in his hand: Taming of the Shrew. . - Cameron and Michael flank Patrick as he shovels food into mouth. You were right. She's still pissed. Sweet love, renew thy force! Man -- don't say shit like that to me. People can hear you. (exasperated) You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score. Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile. What's the worst? You get the girl. Patrick thinks for a minute If go down. 'm takin' her with me . - Kat and the other students sit at their desks, taking a quiz Patrick's seat is conspicuously empty. From outside, we hear the soft, unsure beginnings of a .

""This morning, woke up with this feeling, didn't know how to deal with, and so just decided to myself--"" The rush to the window. Patrick stands beneath the window, crooning. Scurvy is next to him, keeping the beat on the bongos and doing backup vocal s. ""'d hide it to myself. And never talk about it. And didn't go and shout it when you walked into the room --"" He makes quite a sarcastic show of it. Mrs. Blaise touches her heart, as if the song is for her.

(continuing) "" think love you "" The other students laugh, clap, cheer, etc. Kat sinks down, mortified, but with a slight smile . - Patrick and several other miscreants sit quietly, mulling over their misfortune. Nice song, Verona. Flog me. He makes the appropriate hand gesture Mr. Chapin, the gym teacher, sits at the desk in front, ignoring them while he reads a girly weightlifting magazine (0. .) Excuse me, Mr. Chapin? Patrick looks up at the sound of her voice and sees Kat standing in the doorway. She gives him a smile and he perks up a little. Kat walks into the room and addresses Mr. Chapin again. He turns fully to face her. Sir, 'd like to state for the record that Mr. Verona ' s current incarceration is unnecessary. never filed a complaint. . You didn't have to. He disrupted a classroom. Kat glances over at Patrick and motions her head toward the window. Patrick shrugs, not knowing what she ' s talking about. She motions again, and looks toward the window with an expression that says, ""Make a break for it, moron."" Kat brings her attention back to Mr. Chapin while Patrick inches out of his seat toward the window. The other miscreants watch with glee. But, Mr. Chapin, hardly think a simple serenade warrants a week of detention. There are far more hideous acts than off-key singing being performed by the student body on a regular basis. Patrick is halfway out the window now. And none too happy about it, considering they're on the second floor. He eyes a large a few feet away from . . He starts to turn away from Kat . You're not gonna change my mind, Kat. Rules stick. Kat starts to panic, as Patrick has yet to make the jump for the tree. Wait, Mr. Chapin. There's something 've always wanted to show you. He turns back toward her again, the very second before he would have spotted Patrick. Kat glances toward the window. Patrick's just about to make the jump. . What? These. From behind, we see her lift up her shirt and flash her bra at Mr. Chapin, just as Patrick makes the Jump. The miscreants cheer, for both the daring' escape and the flash of skin. Mr. Chapin reddens and tries to be stern. . 'm going to let that slide, Katarina. But if catch you doing that again, you'll be in here with the rest of these guys. He motions to the remaining detention prisoners, without noticing Patrick's absence. Kat smiles at him. Thank you, Mr. Chapin. Kat bolts out the door. Mr. Chapin goes back to his muscle mag, wiping the sweat from his brow. . Kat arrives at the tree. looking around breathlessly, seeing no one. He left! sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me. (0. .) Look up, sunshine She does. He's still in the tree guess never told you 'm afraid of heights. (smiling) 'mon. It's not that bad Try lookin' at it from this angle She assesses the branch structure Put your right foot there -- Forget it. 'm stayin'. You want me to climb up and show you how to get down? (voice trembling) Maybe. She sighs and dose so. When she gets to his level, she perches on the branch next to him. He grins at her. Then swings himself down with the grace and ease of a monkey, leaving her sitting there, realizing she's been duped. You shit! She climbs down after him . - Patrick and Kat walk amongst the games The Partridge Family? figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect. And piss you off. Good call. So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way? dazzled him with my wit She stops and picks up a toy gun that water at giggling hyenas and wails on it. The barker hands her a stuffed animal as her prize. She hands it to the small next to her and they continue walking. (sarcastic) soft side? Who knew? Yeah, well, don't let it get out So what's your excuse? Acting the way we do. Yes don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change. So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered? Something like that Then you screwed up How? You never disappointed me. She blushes under his gaze (continuing) You up for it? For. . . ? He motions to the for a paint-ball game. She grins : The two of them creep through the paint-ball course, stealthy and full of the desire to best the other. Patrick nails Kat in the back with a big glob of red paint Kat gets him in the chest with a glob of blue. Patrick returns fire with a big yellow splat to the side of her face. Kat squirts a green shot to his forehead After a few more shots, they're both covered in paint She tries to shoot him again, only to find that her gun is empty. (continuing) Damn it! Patrick grabs her in a victorious tackle. They land, laughing. It's hard to even recognize them, as their hair and faces are so smeared with paint globs, but they still manage to find each other's eyes. He wipes a smear of blue paint away from her lips, as he goes to kiss her. The kid with the stuffed animal, points Look, Mom His mother hurries him away. What's started as a tackle has turned into a passionate kiss . - Patrick pulls up in Kat's driveway. Their paint wardrobe has dried by now and they look like refugees from some strange, yet colorful, war. State trooper? Fallacy. The duck? Hearsay. know the porn career's a lie. He shuts off the car and turns to her. Do you? He kisses her neck. It tickles. She laughs. Tell me something true. hate peas. No -- something real. Something no one else knows. (in-between kisses) You're sweet. And sexy. And completely hot for me. What? No one else knows You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that? Go to the prom with me Kat's smile disappears. Is that a request or a command? You know what mean No. No what? No, won't go with you Why not? Because don't want to. It's a stupid tradition. Patrick sits quietly, torn. He can't very well tell her he being paid to take her. People won't expect you to go... Kat turns to him, getting angry. Why are you doing this? All of it -- what's in it for you? He sits silently, not looking at her, confirming her suspicions. (continuing) Create a little drama? Start a new rumor? What? So have to have a motive to be with you? You tell me. You need therapy. Has anyone ever told you that? (quietly) Answer the question, Patrick (angry) Nothing! There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company. He takes out a cigarette. She breaks it in half before she the car door and walks into the house. Patrick out of the driveway.

Quick question -- are you going to the prom? Kat pushes the door shut with a . - Cameron and Bianca sit together at their study cubby. She fingers a strand of her hair. Then Guillermo says, ""If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."" No... Bianca stares at him for a moment. do you listen to this crap? What crap? Me. This endless ...blonde babble. 'm like, boring myself. Thank God! If had to hear one more story about your coiffure... He mock stabs himself with a pencil as she giggles and smacks his hand away. (continuing) figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually. What good stuff? The ""real you"". Like my fear of wearing pastels? He looks stricken. (continuing) 'm kidding. (beat) You know how sometimes you just become this ""persona""? And you don't know how to quit? (matter of fact) No Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie. . - Mandella struggles with the lock on her locker. Finally, it opens. Hanging inside is a beautiful , inspired by the 16th Century.

It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook? He's interrupted by Joey's hand on his shoulder.

She's never looked more guilty. . - Kat is sprawled on the couch in sweats, wrapped in a blanket, watching ""Sixteen Candles"". When Molly Ringwald leans across the birthday cake to get a kiss from her dream date, Kat changes the channel disgustedly, settling for an infomercial The phone sits next to her. Not ringing. Bianca breezes in, bearing a cup of tea. Are you sure you don't want to come with us? It'll be fun. Kat takes the tea and gives a weak smile. ' m sure . Bianca sits down next to her You looked beautiful last night, you know. So did you Bianca gives her a squeeze, then jumps up when the rings, opening the door to a waiting Cameron. He peeks his head inside. She okay? hope so. The door shuts behind her as Walter enters. Was that your sister? Yeah. She left with some bikers Big ones. Full of sperm. Funny. Walter sits down on the arm of the chair and watches the infomercial with Kat. (continuing) don't understand the allure of dehydrated food. Is this something should be hip to? No, Daddy. (dreading the answer) So tell me about this dance. Was it fun? Parts of it. Which parts? The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy. Bianca did what? What's the matter? Upset that rubbed off on her? No -- impressed. Kat looks up in surprise. (continuing) You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives. It means we've become spectators. Bianca still lets me play a few innings. You've had me on the bleachers for years. When you go to Sarah Lawrence, won't even be able to watch the game.

Who can tell me at what point Lucentio admits his deception? The door of the classroom open and an angry Kat stalks in, yanking Bianca from her chair and dragging her toward the hallway. (to the teacher) Family emergency. - Bianca tries to pull away as Kat drags her by the hair between two rows of lockers. Let go! You set me up. just wanted -- What? To completely damage me? To send me to therapy forever? What? No! just wanted Miss Perky walks up Ladies? Shall we take a trip to my office? .

(continuing) swear -- didn't know about the money. didn't even know Joey was involved. would never intentionally hurt you, Kat. (to Kat) Do you care to respond? Am supposed to feel better? Like, right now? Or do have some time to think about it? Just smack her now. Bianca rises, taking Kat by the arm. (to Miss Perky) We'll be getting back to you. What, no hug? - And Bianca leave Miss Perky's office Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me? It's just you. - Mrs. Blaise faces the class . All right.

She looks directly at Patrick. He looks back this time. The look they exchange says everything. Then she walks out of the room The rest of the class remains in stunned silence. . - Kat walks to her car alone. When she opens the door, she's greeted with a Fender Stratocaster guitar, reclining in the front seat. She picks it up slowly, inspecting every detail, then spins around. Patrick stands there, smiling. Fender Strat. You bought this? thought you could use it. When you start your band. She doesn't answer, but hides a smile, so he walks closer. (continuing) Besides, had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl. Is that right? Yeah, but then fucked up. fell for her. Blushes and looks down.

The army men each leapfrog behind the stairway banisters and hold their positions while the Sargent surveys the scene below through his binoculars. : ' Directly below, Mrs. Davis passes through the hallway rounding up Andy and all his birthday guests. . Okay, c'mon kids! Everyone in the living room. It's almost time for the presents.

Hey, these guys are professionals. They're the best. 'mon, they're not lying down on the job. . As soon as Mom is gone, the Sargent motions for his men to proceed toward a nearby houseplant that looks into the living room. The Sargent then notices an injured soldier struggling to drag himself forward -- a casualty of Mrs. Davis' foot. The Sargent helps the injured soldier to his feet. (moans) Go on without me. Just go! good soldier never leaves a man behind. The Sargent motions to the remaining men above. They lower themselves via jump rope, riding the baby monitor. Once downstairs, they hustle the baby monitor towards the houseplant. Suddenly... bounces into the hallway, followed by the sound of footsteps and kid clamor.

They conceal themselves in the house plant just before the children run by. . - - While the baby monitor is set in place, evaluates the wounded soldier and gives the ""thumb's up"" signal.

Last present! (..) (over monitor) It's a big one...It's a...it's a boardgame! Repeat! Battleship -- Battleship, the boardgame! The toys . Yeah, alright!! Hamm gives Potato Head a congratulatory pat on the back, sending his facial features flying. . Hey, watch it! Sorry there, old Spudhead. . - (to army men) Mission accomplished. Well done, men. Pack it up, we're going home. . ' So did tell ya? Huh? Nothing to worry about. knew you were right all along, Woody. Never doubted you for a second. . - The platoon is preparing to exit the plant when... . (..) Wait a minute. Oooh, what do we have here?! The Sargent lifts his binoculars back to his eyes. : Mrs. Davis can be seen opening the closet and pulling out another large present. (indicating the baby monitor) Wait -- turn that thing back on! . ' - (..) (over monitor) Come in, Mother Bird, come in, Mother Bird. All the toys tense up. (..) (continued) Mom has pulled a surprise present from the closet. Andy's opening it... . - - He's really excited about this one. It's a huge package. Oh -- get out -- one of the kids is in the way, can't see... . ' - (..) (from monitor) ...it's...it's a -- The sound of children emits from the monitor, cutting off the Sargent. It's a ?! ?!!! Rex grabs a leg of the nightstand and shakes it, making the monitor drop to the floor. The impact causes the batteries to roll out. Oh, no! . Oh, ya big lizard! Now we'll never know what it is! (sarcastic) Way to go, Rex. Everyone rushes to the fallen monitor. Potato Head tries to correctly insert the batteries. No, no! Turn 'em around, turn 'em around! Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards! Plus is positive, minus is negative! Oh, let me! Woody jumps down off the bed and shoves both Hamm and Potato Head aside. . Let's go to my room, guys! The kids rush past the houseplant. (into the monitor) ! ! ! . ' - Woody puts the last battery back in. There. (..) (over monitor) Juvenile intrusion! Repeat! Resume your positions ! Andy's coming, everybody! Back to your places. Hurry! The toys and scatter about the room. . Where's my ear? Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear? Outta my way! Here come, here come -- Frantic, Rex slams into a trashcan and falls over. Everyone scurries to their places as the ' grow louder. Woody falls limp in his spot on the bed just as... Andy's bedroom door flies open and a flood of children's feet rush in. #1 Hey, look! His lasers light up. Take that, Zurg! Woody is flung off Andy's pillow and slides, unnoticed, down the gap between the bed and the back wall. #2 Quick! Make a space! This is where the spaceship lands. -- and you press his back and he does a karate-chop action! . (..) Come on down, guys. It's time for games! We've got prizes! Oh, yeah! The kids all run out as fast as they entered, behind them. The toys slowly come to life and make their way toward the bed. . What is it? Can you see it? What the heck is up there? Woody? Who's up there with you? Woody crawls out from under the bed. The toys are shocked to discover him there. Woody, what are you doing under the bed? (composing himself) Uh-h-h-h...nothing! Uh, nothing. 'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all. Too much cake and ice cream, suppose. It's just a mistake. . Well, that is sitting in your spot, Woody. (!) Have you been replaced? Hey! What did tell you earlier? No one is getting replaced. The toys give each other a look of doubt. Now let's all be polite, and give whatever it is up there a nice, big ""Andy's Room"" welcome. Woody climbs slowly up the side of the bed, peeking over the edge. His eyes widen at the sight of... We see Buzz as Woody does - an expensive looking space age action figure, covered with buttons and stickers from head to toe. The imposing "".. Joe-sized"" doll stands heroically in the center of the bed, his back to Woody. Woody . Buzz comes alive and looks around. : ' While he scans the bedroom a "" "" is heard. Buzz eyes it all suspiciously and pushes a button on his chest. : Buzz Lightyear to Star Command. Come in, Star Command. Nothing. He pushes the button again. Star Command - come in. Do you read me? (to himself) Why don't they answer?!! Just then, Buzz catches sight of his ripped packaging. The box is designed to look like a spaceship. () My ship!! He runs up to the box and investigates the damage. Blast! This'll take weeks to repair! Buzz flips open a plastic compartment on his arm -- his wrist communicator. Buzz Lightyear Mission Log. Stardate 4072: My ship has run off course en route to sector 12. 've crash landed on a strange planet. The impact must have awoken me from hyper-sleep. Buzz springs up and down on the squishy surface of the bed. (into communicator) Terrain seems a bit unstable... He taps the sticker of controls on his wrist communicator. (into communicator) No read-out yet if the air is breathable... and there seems to be no sign of intelligent life anywhere -- : ' Woody's face suddenly pops into view. Hello-o-o... -!!! Buzz jumps back, taking a fighting stance. He presses a button on his arm that turns on a red ""laser beam"" light on his wrist. Buzz aims the red beam on Woody's forehead and holds it there. Aaaaaaah! Whoa, hey, whoa, did frighten you? Didn't mean to. Sorry. Howdy! My name is Woody and this is Andy's room. That's all wanted to say, and also, there has been a bit of a mix-up. This is my spot, see, the bed here -- While Woody is speaking, Buzz notices the sheriff's badge on Woody's vest. (de-activating his laser beam) Local law enforcement! It's about time you got here. 'm Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger, Universe Protection Unit. My ship has crash landed here by mistake. Buzz begins walking around the bed, surveying the situation. Woody tries to keep up. Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot. need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion? Well, let's see, we've got double 's -- Watch yourself!! Buzz shoves Woody down on the bed and re-activates his wrist laser. (continued) Halt! Who goes there?! The other toys are peeking over the edge of the bed. Don't shoot! It's okay! Friends! (to Woody) Do you know these life forms? Yes. They're Andy's toys. Alright, everyone. You're clear to come up. Buzz walks over to the toys. am Buzz Lightyear. come in peace. Rex steps forward and eagerly shakes Buzz's hand. Oh, 'm so glad you're not a dinosaur! Why, thank you... (pulls away) Now thank you all for your kind welcome. Say! What's that button do? 'll show you. Buzz presses a button on his chest. ( ) Buzz Lightyear to the rescue! The toys all . Hey, Woody's got something like that. His is a pullstring, only it -- . Only it sounds like a car ran over it. Oh yeah, but not like this one. This is a quality sound system. Probably all copper wiring, huh? So, uh, where are you from? Singapore? Hong Kong? Well...no, actually 'm stationed up in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector 4. As a member of the elite Universe Protection Unit of the Space Ranger Corps, protect the galaxy from the threat of invasion from the Evil Emperor Zurg, sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance. As Buzz speaks, Woody glances down at the box in which Buzz arrived. : ' There is a cartoon drawing of Buzz giving the exact, word- for-word spiel that Buzz is now giving. . Oh, really? 'm from Playskool. And 'm from Mattel. Well, 'm not actually from Mattel, 'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out. Well, don't really understand the financials, but... Woody walks over to Bo Peep. You'd think they've never seen a new toy before. Well sure, look at him. He's got more gadgets on him then a Swiss army knife. Slinky presses the button on Buzz's arm, activating his laser light. Buzz quickly pulls his arm away. Ah, ah, ah, please be careful! You don't want to be in the way when my laser goes off. . Hey, a laser! How come you don't have a laser, Woody? It's not a laser! It's a little lightbulb that blinks! What's with him? . Laser-envy. All right, that's enough. Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy -- Toy? --. Toy. Excuse me, think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger. The word 'm searching for can't say because there's pre-school toys present. . Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you? Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear? Now 'm curious. What does a Space Ranger actually do? He's not a Space Ranger! He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly -- Excuse me. Buzz calmly hits a button and wings pop out. Again the toys . Oh, impressive wingspan. Very good! Oh, what?!...What?! These are plastic. He can't fly! They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and fly. No, you can't. Yes, can. You can't! Can! Can't! Can't! Can't! tell you, could fly around this room with my eyes closed! Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer! Prove it. All right, then, will. (to toys) Stand back everyone! The crowd of toys make room for Buzz as he heads towards the edge of the bed and climbs up the bedpost. He poses like a high diver, shuts his eyes... To infinity and beyond!! ...and leaps off the bed. Buzz plummets straight down, hits a big rubber ball and bounces right back up. He then lands on a Hotwheels car, which races him down the track, through the loop, and off a ramp. Buzz soars upward into a plane mobile hanging from the ceiling. Buzz becomes wedged between the plane's wheels. The impact turns on the ' making it (and Buzz) spin around and around. All the other toys watch from the bed, mesmerized. Finally the centrifugal force causes Buzz to separate from the plane, sailing him across the room toward the bed. Buzz makes a perfect landing right in front of Woody and then opens his eyes. Can. The crowd of toys rush Buzz, . Whoa! Oh, wow! You flew magnificently! found my moving buddy! Why, thank you. Thank you all. Thank you. That wasn't flying! That was falling with style! . Man, the dolls must really go for you! (aside) Can you teach me that? Woody stands alone at the other end of the bed, fuming. Slinky, caught up in the euphoria, approaches Woody. Heh, heh, heh! Golly bob howdy -- Oh, shut up! In a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was. They'll see... they'll see. 'm still Andy's favorite toy. : plays over montage. . ' - ) Andy plays with Woody: jumping up and down on the bed, running around the room. ) Andy sets Woody down on the floor. Next he ""lands"" Buzz Lightyear on the floor opposite Woody. Andy shoots Buzz's laser at Woody and then smacks Woody across the room as if he'd been blown away by the laser. ) Andy runs into his closet wearing his cowboy hat and cowboy pajamas. : Andy runs out of the closet clad in Buzz Lightyear pajamas and a homemade spaceman's helmet. Buzz Lightyear to the rescue. ) Woody observes all the cowboy-themed items in the bedroom transform to space motif: the posters, the drawings on the wall, the pillow, the bedspread. ) Buzz watches Rex execute a . The space ranger suggests a few tips for the dinosaur. Rex tries again, this time giving a "" "" . The roar blasts Potato Head's features right off his face. ) Woody passes Etch--Sketch, who's sporting a portrait of Buzz. Woody looks across the room to see Buzz combing Troll Doll's hair, chatting away like a hair dresser. Woody angrily shakes Etch, removing Buzz's image. ) Rocky, Snake, Troll Doll and Rex are lifting Tinkertoys as weights. Buzz works out on top of an upside down Robot, using his feet as a treadmill. Potato Head attempts to lift his Tinkertoy barbell but ends up tumbling backwards, leaving his arms connected to the barbell. ) Woody looks under the bed for Slinky, finding only the checkerboard. Woody peeks around the corner of the bed to see Slinky and Robot, under Buzz's direction, setting Buzz's ""ship"" up on top of blocks for repair. In frustration, Woody kicks the checkerboard, sending the pieces flying. One of the checkers ricochets off the dresser and boomerangs into Woody's mouth. ) On Andy's bed, Buzz pets Slinky whose back end is stretched over to the other side where Woody sits. Slinky's wagging tail whacks Woody in the face repeatedly. Woody shoves Slinky's rear end off the bed, leaving his front end no choice but to eventually follow. ) At bedtime, Andy loads his toys into the toybox until just Woody and Buzz are left. He deliberates as to which toy to keep and which to toss into the toybox. . ' - Andy is sound asleep, with Buzz tucked under the covers next to him. Woody peeks out at them from the toybox and then sadly sinks back into the box, closing the lid to... / The black screen splits horizontally to become... . ' - - ' All is clear -- no sign of Andy. Woody throws open the lid of the toy box. Finally! He takes a couple of fresh air, then discovers that his hat is missing. (looking back into the toy box) Hey! Who's got my hat? The rubber shark pops up wearing Woody's cowboy hat. Look, 'm Woody. Howdy, howdy, howdy! (sarcastic) Ah-hah! Ah-hah-hah! (grabs the hat) Give me that! Woody leaps out of the toy box. (..) Say there, Lizard and Stretchy Dog. Let me show you something. It looks as though 've been accepted into your culture. Woody looks up to see Buzz chatting with Rex and Slinky. (continued) Your Chief, Andy, inscribed his name on me. Buzz puts his foot out so that Slinky and Rex can see the sole of his boot. The name """" is written on it in permanent marker. & Wow! With permanent ink, too! Well, must get back to repairing my ship. Buzz walks away. Woody looks at foot -- ""Andy"" is written on it also but in a much more childish scrawl, and is largely faded. (..) Don't let it get to you, Woody. Hearing Bo, Woody puts his foot back down and quickly straightens up. (nonchalant) Uh, let what? don't -- Uh, what do you mean? Who? know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you. . (walking past) Yeah. Like the attic. Heh, heh... Alright! That's it! Woody angrily marches across the room. Across the room, Buzz's cardboard ship is still up on the blocks. Buzz lies down on a skateboard and slides under the ship like a mechanic. Snake and Robot stand by waiting for instructions. Buzz's hand reaches out from under the ship. Unidirectional bonding strip. Robot turns towards Snake who stands in readiness by a tape dispenser. Mr. Lightyear wants more tape! Snake rips off a piece of tape with his mouth. Woody approaches the skateboard, grabs hold of Buzz's foot and rolls him out from under the ship. Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy. He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me. What are you talking about? (to Robot) Where's that bonding strip?! Buzz rolls himself back under. Woody rolls him out again. And another thing. Stop with this spaceman thing. It's getting on my nerves. Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command? Oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh? Buzz stands up, face to face with Woody. Don't even think about it, cowboy! Oh, yeah, tough guy?! Woody pushes Buzz in the chest, accidentally activating a button that makes the spaceman's helmet open. Buzz grabs his neck, . He drops to his knees and begins to writhe on the ground, holding his breath. Woody is unsure how to react. Suddenly, Buzz the air. The air isn't toxic. Buzz rises and points an accusing finger at Woody. How dare you open a spaceman's helmet on an uncharted planet! My eyeballs could've been sucked from their sockets! Buzz closes his helmet. You actually think you're ""Buzz Lightyear?"" Oh, all this time thought it was an act! (to the room) Hey, guys! Look! It's the Buzz Lightyear! You're mocking me, aren't you? Oh, no, no, no... (pointing behind Buzz) Buzz, look! An alien! Where? Buzz falls for the trick and turns around. Woody kneels over with . : Woody stops short. All the toys look to the bedroom window. (..) Yessss! Ah, ha, ha, ha... Uh-oh. Slinky hides under the bed. It's Sid! thought he was at summer camp! They must have kicked him out early this year. The toys rush over to the window. Oh, no! Not Sid! (..) ...Incoming! From out the window, , a hyperactive ten-year- old, and his dog, , can be roughly made out jumping around in their backyard. tiny figure stands isolated in the center of the yard. Sid pummels the figure with rocks while Scud strains at his leash, barking wildly. . Who is it this time? can't tell. Hey, where's Lenny? (..) Right here, Woody. Woody turns to see, , a pair of wind-up binoculars, approaching him from the other end of the desk. Woody picks Lenny up and looks through him to survey the scene. Oh, no. can't bear to watch one of these again! : ' full size toy soldier is posed in a running stance in the center of the backyard. huge -80 is strapped to the doll's back with masking tape. Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl. (..) (plays under the next 5 lines) Just stay where you are, Corporal! Don't move, Carl. You'll blow up. know you're tired! know your leg is cramping, but you can't move. Do you hear me? Buzz breaks through the crowd. What's going on? Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us . 'd better take a look anyway. Buzz grabs Lenny from Woody and looks through him. Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device? (redirecting Buzz's view) That's why. Sid. : , Sure is a hairy fellah. No! No, that's Scud, you idiot! Again, Woody readjusts Buzz's view. : He is sporting a skull t-shirt and . is Sid! You mean that happy child? . That ain't no happy child. He tortures toys -- just for fun. Well, then we've got to do something! Buzz steps up onto the window ledge. The toys . What are you doing?!! Get down from there! 'm going to go teach that boy a lesson. Yeah, sure. You go ahead. Melt him with your scary laser. Woody presses Buzz's laser button. It emits a . Buzz quickly pulls his arm away. Be careful with that, it's extremely dangerous. While Woody and Buzz banter, Lenny witnesses Sid lighting the fuse of the M80. He's lighting it! He's lighting it! (..) ----!!! -----! Hit the dirt! The toys jump away from the window. : Dirt clouds and toy shrapnel rain down along the side of Andy's house. (..) Yes! He's gone! He's history! Andy's toys peek over the window sill. : ' large black scorch mark is all that remains where Combat Carl once stood. Sid jumps up and down victoriously while Scud resumes his . could have stopped him. Buzz, would love to see you try. (gesturing to Sid's yard) 'Course 'd love to see you as a crater. Sid and dances around the crater. The sooner we move the better. : . ' - "" "" real estate sign stands in the front yard. Another sign reading """" hangs from the bottom. . /' Mom opens the door to Andy's room and steps in. The room is full of packing boxes, most of them half full. Andy is playing with Woody and Buzz. To infinity and beyond! . Oh, all this packing makes me hungry. What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet? Pizza Planet?! Oh, cool! Andy throws the two toys on his desk with Buzz landing right on top of Woody. . Go wash your hands and 'll get Molly ready. The minute the door is closed Woody comes alive and shoves Buzz off of him. (..) Can bring some toys? . (..) You can bring toy... (..) Just one? Woody perks up with concern. (to himself) One toy? He glances over his shoulder at Buzz, who is walking away towards the opposite end of the desk. Woody picks up a Magic 8 Ball left beside him on the desk. With his back to Buzz, Woody quietly shakes the 8 ball. (whispering) Will Andy pick me? He tips the 8 ball over. The triangular oracle floats up to the surface. Its prediction reads: ' . Don't count on it?!! Doh-h-h-h! Woody throws down the 8 ball in disgust. It rolls across the desk and falls behind it with a . Woody suddenly becomes interested in the back of the desk and peers down it. : The 8 ball is wedged way down near the bottom. The space is a black chasm, dark and deep, just big enough to fit...a toy. Woody looks across the desk at Buzz. He is as he forages through Andy's pen/pencil tray looking for ""tools"" to repair his ship with. Right behind Buzz sits It rests on the desktop, pointing in the direction where the 8 ball fell, with the remote laying by its side. Woody smiles for a beat and then runs in a panic over to Buzz. Buzz!! Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!! Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness! We've got trouble! Trouble?! (looking around) Where?! (pointing to the back of the desk) Down there. Just down there. helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz! Then we've no time to lose!! Buzz runs over and looks down the back of the desk. don't see anything! Woody picks up the remote for the Car and switches it on. 's eyes (headlights) open sleepily. Oh, he's there. Just, just keep looking. Woody hits the """" button on the remote and steers the Car straight for Buzz. What kind of a toy -- ? Buzz turns to see headed straight for him. He dives out of the way as the Car into the base of... The impact forces pushpins to fly out of the board. Buzz ducks as pins land all around him, sticking into the desk like arrows. sits on the floor in the midst of a card game with Hamm. He looks up at the desk and as the bulletin board slams down onto... knocking it out of its stand. The globe starts rolling right at Buzz. Woody stands frozen in disbelief at the chaos he's created. Buzz runs along the desk, the globe rolling right behind him, Indiana Jones style. Buzz gets stuck ""log rolling"" on a pile of pencils, but at the last second jumps out of the way onto the window ledge. The globe lumbers past Buzz and strikes a Luxo-style desklamp. The arm of the lamp swings all the way around, barely missing Woody... ...and knocks Buzz out the window. !!!! Buzz!!! Woody looks out the window. No sign of Buzz. All the other toys rush over to the sill. don't see him in the driveway! think he bounced into Sid's yard. Woody backs away from the , unnoticed. () Buzz! (electric motor sounds) Whirrr!! Whirrrr-whirrrr!!! Rex looks over at . The remote control car is bouncing up and down excitedly. Hey everyone! 's trying to say something! The toys turn from the window to . (leaning down close to ) What is it, boy? (electric motor sounds) Whirrr!!! Whirrr! Whirrrrrr!! . He's sayin' that this was no accident. Huh? What do you mean? . mean Humpty Dumpty was pushed... (pointing at Woody) ...by Woody. ?!? The toys turn to Woody who suddenly realizes how this looks. Wait a minute. You -- you don't think meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head? . That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer! Now, it was an accident! Guys, c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me We believe you, Woody. Right, Rex? (backing away) Oh, don't like confrontations. The Sargent pops out of the army bucket next to Woody. Where is your honor, dirtbag?! You are an absolute disgrace! You don't deserve to -- Woody seals the lid back on the bucket. Potato Head starts closing in on Woody. . Couldn't handle Buzz cuttin' in on your playtime, could ya Woody? Didn't want to face the fact that Buzz just might be Andy's new favorite toy, so you got rid of him. Well, what if Andy starts playin' with me more, Woody, huh? You gonna knock me outta the window, too? Potato Head has driven Woody back to the very edge of the desk -- trapped. don't think we should give him the chance. Suddenly, the lid pops off the bucket of army men. There he is, men! Frag him! The army men yell and pounce on Woody, while all the rest of the toys close in. . Let's string him up by his pull- string! got dibs on his hat! Would you boys stop it?! Tackle him! No, no, no, no! Wait! Wait can explain everything -- . (..) Andy, c'mon! (..) Okay, Mom, be right down. 've got to get Buzz. Retreat! The toys all drop Woody and rush back to their places. Andy enters the room and heads straight for the desk where Woody is lying. Andy overlooks Woody and begins searching around the room. Mom! Do you know where Buzz is? . (..) No, haven't seen him. Woody painfully watches as Andy searches in vain for Buzz. . (..) Psssst! Woody looks across the room. Potato Head and Etch--Sketch peek out of a packing box. Etch--Sketch scribbles a hangman's noose while Potato Head points an accusing finger in Woody's direction. Woody . . (..) Andy! 'm heading out the door. But Mom, can't find him! . (..) Well, honey, just grab some other toy! Now c'mon! Okay... He grabs Woody and walks out of the room. . ' - Andy exits the house dragging Woody as he heads toward the family van in the driveway. couldn't find my Buzz. know left him right there. . Honey, 'm sure he's around. You'll find him. next to the van begins to rustle. Hands part the foliage, revealing Buzz. He eyes Woody going into the van and does a slow burn. The van . Buzz races out of the bush, and with a mighty leap, grabs the rear fender of the van as it pulls out of the driveway. : ' chain of monkeys falls into view, dangling a considerable distance above the ground. . ' - The rest of Andy's toys have regrouped at the window, supervising the lowering of the ""monkey chain."" It's too short! We need more monkeys! (holding up an empty barrel) There aren't any more! That's the whole barrel. Rex throws the barrel down and runs back to the ledge. (yelling out window) Buzz! The monkeys aren't working! We're formulating another plan! Stay calm! (beat) Oh, where could he be? . - The Davis' family van pulls up to one of the pumps. . - Andy sits in the rear seat with Woody lying next to him. Can help pump the gas? . Sure! 'll even let you drive. Both Mrs. Davis and Andy exit the van while baby Molly sleeps up front in her car seat. (..) Yeah?! . (..) Yeah -- when you're sixteen. (..) (sarcastic) Yuk, yuk, yuk -- funny, Mom. With Mom and Andy out of range, Woody comes to life. He stares out the sun roof, still reeling from everything. Oh, great. How am gonna convince those guys it was an accident? Suddenly, Buzz appears over the edge of the sun roof. Buzz! Buzz jumps down on the back seat to face Woody. He is furious. Buzz! You're alive! This is great! Oh, 'm saved! 'm saved! Andy'll find you here, he'll take us back to the room, and then you can tell everyone that this was all just a big mistake. Huh? No response from Buzz. Just an angry stare. (weakly) Right? Buddy? just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet. Oh. Oh, that's good. (getting in Woody's face) But we're not on my planet, are we? No. Buzz lunges for Woody. The two toys fly off the seat and out the open side door of the van. . - Woody and Buzz hit the ground and roll under the van, locked in mortal combat. Ok! Come on! You want a piece of me?! Buzz lands a punch that sends Woody's head spinning around. Woody lunges with all his might. He smacks Buzz in the face, making it with every blow. Buzz closes his helmet on Woody's hand. Owwwww!!! Woody pounds on Buzz's chest with his free hand, activating ' buttons. : The toys stop fighting. Before they can react... . (..) Next stop... (..) Pizza Planet! Yeah!!! The van drives off. () Andy?! Woody starts to run in the direction of the van but it drives out of sight, leaving Buzz and Woody stranded. Doesn't he realize that 'm not there? (beat) 'm ! Oh, 'm a lost toy! Meanwhile, Buzz checks the surroundings. He flips open his wrist communicator. Buzz Lightyear Mission Log. The local Sheriff and seem to be at a huge refueling station of some sort -- Woody whips around, his expression changing from panic to seething anger. He charges at Buzz. You! : Just then the toys are bathed in the headlight beams of a behemoth tanker truck pulling into the station. Buzz dives off to the side while Woody collapses right where he stands on the pavement. The truck over him. stops just millimeters from Woody's nose. Petrified, Woody inches away from the tire, moving back under the truck until he bumps into Buzz. (into wrist communicator) According to my nava-computer, the -- (whispering) Shut up! Just shut up, you idiot!! Sheriff, this is no time to panic. This is the perfect time to panic! 'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!! My fault?! If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place -- Oh, yeah? Well, if hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me -- Don't talk to me about importance. Because of the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy. (incredulous) ?!! What are you talking about?! Buzz walk to the edge of the truck tire and points up to the stars. Right now, poised at the edge of the galaxy, Emperor Zurg has been secretly building a weapon with the destructive capacity to annihilate an entire planet. alone have information that reveals this weapon's only weakness. (pointing at Woody) And you, my friend, are responsible for delaying my rendez-vous with Star Command. Woody explodes. !!! You aren't the real Buzz Lightyear, you're an action figure!! You are a child's plaything!!! Beat. You are a sad strange little man and you have my pity. Farewell. Buzz walks off. Oh, yeah? Well, good riddance, ya looney! Woody walks away in the opposite direction. (to himself) Rendez-vous with Star Command. : (..) Hey, Gas Dude! (..) You talkin' to me? (..) Yeah, man, can you help me? Do you know where Cutting Blvd. is? (..) Just a moment... Woody looks in the direction of the bell. His face lights up at the sight of... . (to himself) Pizza Planet...Andy! Woody takes a step forward and then stops. Oh, no! can't show my face in that room without Buzz. Woody runs back under the tanker truck. Buzz is at the far end of the truck, walking away from Woody. Buzz! Buzz, come back! (continuing to walk away) Go away. Woody looks back at the delivery truck in desperation and then eyes... : Atop the truck is a rocket with the Pizza Planet logo. No, Buzz, you've gotta come back. found a spaceship! Buzz stops walking away and looks back at Woody. It's a spaceship, Buzz! . - The delivery truck's engine has stalled and is off. (..) 'mon, man, hurry up. Um, like the pizza's are getting cold here. Woody and Buzz eye the parked delivery truck from within the safety of a nearby oilcan display. Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply? Uh-huh. And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home. Well, then let's climb abroad. Buzz makes a beeline for the passenger side door of the pizza truck. Woody chases after him. No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's get in the back. No one will see us there. Negative. There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area. We'll be much safer in the cockpit. In a flash, Buzz has scaled the front tire, grabbed the rear view mirror, and swung himself up and into the cab. (loud whisper) Yeah, but, Buzz! Buzz! (..) Ok, so that's two lefts, and then a right, huh? (..) Yeah. (..) Okay, thanks for the directions. (loud whisper) Buzz! : Woody runs around to the back of the truck, scrambles up the bumper and throws open the back hatch to climb inside. Woody lets out a , as the back hatch slams back down on his rear, sending him flying into the bed of the truck. . - Woody peeks through the dividing window into the cab. Buzz is hidden from 's view by a stack of pizzas in their insulated covers. Buzz prudently fastens his safety belt. It'll be safer in the cockpit than the cargo bay. What an idiot! The driver shifts into gear and hits the gas, propelling Woody to the back of the truck. The pizza deliverer drives like a maniac, taking sharp turns and hills at high speeds. Woody is helplessly thrown around the truck. With every blow, Woody in pain. The truck climbs a steep hill. Woody looks up just in time to see... barreling towards him. !!! : - We to reveal... . - The delivery truck barrels into the parking lot and parks. . - - After the driver leaves the truck, Buzz peeks out from the passenger window. : Two imposing animatronic robots guard the doorway. As approach the front, the guards part their crossed ""pizza spears,"" allowing the patrons to enter. You are clear to enter. Welcome to Pizza Planet. blare out from speakers: Next shuttle lift-off scheduled for -minus 30 minutes and counting... The white zone is for eating pizza only. The white zone is for... Excited, Buzz pries open the window between the cab and truck bed. Sheriff! Woody is gone. Just the toolbox and strewn trash. (continued) Sheriff? The toolbox falls on its side revealing Woody. He peels off the back of the truck and falls into a pile of trash. There you are. Now the entrance is heavily guarded. We need a way to get inside. Woody rises from the trash with a ""-"" cup on his head. Great idea, Woody! like your thinking! . - In the f.g. sits a trashcan with fast food containers littered around it. approach the ""guarded"" entrance. You are clear to enter. Welcome to Pizza Planet. The front doors automatically swing open as the people pass through. Suddenly two pieces of trash -- a burger container and ""-"" cup stand up. (in burger container) ! The two disguised toys make a dash through the closing doors. (in container) Quickly, Sheriff! The airlock is closing. . - - Woody and Buzz just make it inside but then freeze immediately as a run past, forcing the toys to pose as discarded trash. Once the coast is clear, Woody and Buzz resume walking. Buzz bumps into Woody. (using straw as periscope) Ow! Watch where you're going! (mouthing with burger box) Sorry. They sneak in between two long rows of video games and throw off their disguises. They then take a good look at... The space-themed arena is filled with hordes of children playing video games. sea of - and lights overwhelm the place. Buzz is beaming with hope. What a space port. Good work, Woody. Woody is busy looking at all the children in the arcade, but none of the kids look familiar to him. Just then he ... (..) Mom, can play Black Hole? Please, please, please?! Woody turns around and through the video games he spots... standing with Mom and Molly in her stroller. (to himself) Andy! . What's Black Hole? Oh, it's so cool... The family begins to walk away. Now we need to find a ship that's headed for Sector 12 -- Buzz is about to head off in the opposite direction when Woody grabs him and quickly pulls him down the video corridor. Wait a minute! No Buzz! This way! There's a special ship. just saw it! You mean it has hyperdrive? Hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf. The toys manage to get ahead of Andy. Woody peeks around the corner of one of the video games and waits for Mom and Andy to approach. (tracking Andy and family) 'mon, c'mon, that's it... Where is it? don't see the -- Buzz stops short at the sight of... It is modeled to look like a spaceship ready to launch. (continued) Spaceship. Alright Buzz, get ready... Buzz heads for the crane game, but Woody does not notice, his eyes locked on the approaching stroller. Okay, Buzz, when say ""go,"" we're gonna jump in the basket -- Woody turns and realizes Buzz is gone. He looks across the way just in time to see Buzz leap into the crane game through the """" slot. (loud whisper) Buzz! Woody turns back in the direction of the stroller. It has already gone past. Dooh! No! This cannot be happening to me!! Woody runs towards the crane game, but is forced to hold back for a moment as some children pass by. . Buzz climbs over the partition that divides the deposit slot from the prize toys and leaps into a pile of... There are hundreds of them, all identical and way too cute. #1 (excited) stranger! #2 From the outside! Oo-o-o-o-o-o... Greetings! am Buzz Lightyear! come in peace! Tell us! What is it like outside? The squeeze toys rush Buzz like excited children. . With the kids gone, Woody crosses the aisle to the crane game and dives through the prize slot. . - Woody clambers up the side of the deposit slot. (..) This is an intergalactic emergency! need to commandeer your vessel to Sector 12! Woody peeks over the partition to witness Buzz surround by the cute alien toys. (continued; to the aliens) Who's in charge here? All the aliens point upward. The cla-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-w!! Woody and Buzz look up. : It dangles directly above the toys. #1 The claw is our master. #2 The claw chooses who will go and who will stay. (to himself) This is ludicrous. (..) (laughter) Woody at the recognition of Sid's voice. He turns to see Sid heading straight for the crane game. Oh, no! Sid!!! Woody leaps off the partition and tackles Buzz, pushing the two of them deep into the pile of aliens. Get down!! Sid approaches the crane game and fishes quarters out of his pants pocket. (loud whisper) What's gotten into you, Sheriff? was -- (loud whisper) are the one that decided to climb into this -- #4 (loud whisper) Sh-h-h-h-h-h. The claw. It moves. : It moves into position and hovers directly above the area where Woody and Buzz are hiding. The crane drops and grabs hold of the alien toy that is right on top of Buzz. #3 (whispering excitedly) have been chosen!! Positioned with his back to Sid, the alien is lifted up by the claw. #3 (continued) Farewell, my friends! go on to a better place. Gotcha! With the alien gone, Buzz's upper torso becomes exposed, forcing the space ranger to freeze. Sid suddenly spots Buzz. Buzz Lightyear! No way! Woody, still hidden, frantically looks around for some way to escape. Behind him, through the aliens, he eyes... Woody swims through the alien squeeze toys toward the door. He grabs hold of the locking latch and, after a few attempts, is able to pry the door open. The shadow of the crane lines up over Buzz, lowers, and grabs his head. Yes! The claw begins to lift Buzz up. () Buzz, ! Woody grabs hold of Buzz's feet. Woody and the claw begin to have a tug-of-war with Buzz. Woody pulls down hard, forcing Buzz to sink into the pile of aliens, out of Sid's view. (slamming his fist against the glass) Wha -- ? Hey!! Still tugging against the crane, Woody is almost out the door with Buzz. Just then, the aliens at the bottom of the pile pull Buzz and Woody back inside. #4 He has been chosen. Hey! What are you doing? #5 He must go. Stop it, you -- ! Stop it, you zealots! He must go! Do not fight the claw! Do not anger the claw! He has been chosen. Woody and Buzz are pushed up to the surface and into the air, dangling lifelessly in front of Sid. Alright! Double prizes! Woody and Buzz are dropped into the prize door slot and snatched up by Sid. (looking at his two new toys) Let's go home and...play. Ha-ha-ha. : ' - : . ' - From out of the darkness appears Sid on his skateboard. He is to rock music from his walkman while carrying his backpack in his hand. Sid leaps off the skateboard and walks up the front path towards the front door. Through the open zipper, Buzz peeks out of the backpack to see Sid's house. He recognizes Andy's house next door. . - Buzz, Woody and a squeeze toy alien are scrunched up in the backpack. Sheriff! can see your dwelling from here! You're almost home. Nirvana is coming! The mystic portal awaits! (to Alien) Will you be quiet?!! (to both) You guys don't get it, do you? Once we go into Sid's house, we won't be coming out. : ' The front door opens to reveal Scud. The dog lunges straight for the backpack, . Whoa, Scud! Hey, boy. Sit! Good boy! The dog begrudgingly obeys. Hey, got somethin' for ya, boy. Sid's hand reaches into the backpack. (loud whisper) !!! The toys go still. Sid's hand grabs the alien out of the backpack. The alien is then placed sideways along Scud's snout. Ready, set, . In one quick motion, Scud flips the alien up, catches it in his mouth, and rabidly shakes it back and forth. Buzz and Woody react in horror. Hannah! Hey, Hannah!!! Woody and Buzz glance up to see , Sid's frail little sister, carrying her Janie Doll. What? Did get my package in the mail? dunno. Whaddaya mean, you don't know? (insistent) don't know! (mock concern) Oh no, Hannah! What? Look! Janie! He grabs the doll. Hey!! She's sick! (panic rising) No she's -- 'll have to perform one of my...operations! --... Don't touch her! ! Sid bolts upstairs with Hannah in pursuit. Not Sid's room...not there... . - Sid races to his bedroom door. Hannah is right behind. Sid! Give her back! Sid just . He charges into the room and slams the door in his sister's face. . ' - (..) (pounding on his door) Sid! Sid!... Sid carelessly tosses the backpack on the bed and walks over to a makeshift workbench. (as Doctor) Oh, no. We have a sick patient here, nurse. Prepare the .., ! Sid on a bare bulb dangling above his ""operating table."" Woody and Buzz look on from the safety of the backpack as Sid places the Janie doll's head in a vise. (..) Sid, give her back! Give her back now! 'm telling! (as Doctor) Patient is... (straining while tightening vise) ...pre-e-epped. Sid grabs a painter's mask from his toolchest and dons it like a surgeon's mask. (as Doctor) No one's ever attempted a double bypass brain transplant before. Sid grabs a toy pterodactyl from a nearby crate full of junk. (as Doctor) Now for the tricky part -- pliers! (whispering to Woody) don't believe that man's ever been to medical school. Sid struggles for a moment with his ""patient"" then stops. (as Nurse) Doctor, you've done it! (running to the door) Hannah? He opens the door. Hannah is standing there, looking worried. (continued) Janie's all better now. He hands her Janie -- her head has been replaced with a pterodactyl's. Hannah at the sight of the monstrosity and bolts down the hallway. !! !! She's lying! Whatever she says it's not true! Sid throws the doll to the ground and runs after Hannah, slamming the door behind him. Woody and Buzz peer out of the backpack at their new surroundings. Heavy metal posters, discarded toy remains and power tools adorn the messy room. They are in Hell...toy Hell. We are gonna die. (bolting out of the pack) 'm outta here! Woody leaps from the bed to the doorknob and struggles to open it. No good. Woody drops to the floor. Locked! There's gotta be another way out of here. : Woody is startled by the noise. small yo-yo rolls out from behind a box and falls on its side. Spooked, Woody grabs a pencil from the floor and brandishes it like a weapon. Just then a shadow passes by Woody. He turns quickly but sees nothing. Uh...Buzz? Was that you? Woody hurriedly trades his pencil for a larger flashlight. He hears a from under Sid's bed. Woody turns on the flashlight and shines the beam in the direction of the noise, illuminating... ' Hey! Hi, there, little fellah! Come out here. Do you know a way out of here? The baby doll moves out from under the bed, revealing a one- eyed doll head atop a spider-like body made of erector set pieces. (!!) The creature extends its legs and rises up taller than Woody. Scared speechless, Woody keeps his flashlight beam locked on . Various other begin to emerge from the shadows: a toy fishing pole with fashion doll legs, a skateboard with a combat soldier's torso screwed to the front end, a jack- in-the-box with a rubber hand for a head, (and others). Woody leaps onto the bed and hides behind Buzz. ---Buzz! Buzz and Woody look on as the mutants have a tug of war as they grab all the Janie and pterodactyl parts, dragging them off into the shadows. They're cannibals! Woody retreats back into the backpack. . - Woody cowers in the corner as Buzz enters. He punches a button on his chest. May day! May day! Come in, Star Command! Send reinforcements!... (pause) Star Command, do you copy? No response. Buzz adjusts his laser light. It emits a short . (aiming his arm out the pack) 've set my laser from stun to kill. Oh, great, great. Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death. . ' - Rex points a flashlight out of Andy's bedroom window while Bo Peep, Slinky, Hamm and Potato Head look on. Some bushes rustle below. Hey, you guys! think 've found him. Buzz! Is that you?! Rex points the flashlight beam at the shaking bushes. The annoyed of a cat is heard. Whiskers! Will you get out of here?! You're interfering with the search and rescue. : Rex turns off the flashlight. (whispering) Look! They're home! The toys duck behind the sill. The Davis' family van pulls into the driveway. Andy and Mrs. Davis get out. Mom, have you seen Woody? . Where was the last place you left him? (searching the van) Right here in the van. . Oh, 'm sure he's there. You're just not looking hard enough. He's not here, Mom. Woody's gone. The toys all look at one another. () Woody's gone?! Well waddah-ya-know, the weasel ran away. Hamm, Potato Head and Rex walk away from the window. . Huh?! Huh?! told you he was guilty. Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?! Bo Peep and Slinky are left alone at the window, visibly crestfallen. Oh, Slink, hope he's okay. : . ' - (..) (as Interrogator) Oh, a survivor. Where is the rebel base? Talk! : . ' - An inanimate Woody flies across the room, landing hard on the floor. Sid crosses to the window. (as Interrogator) can see your will is strong. Sid opens the window shade. Bright sunlight shines down onto Woody. (continued) Well, we have ways of making you talk. Sid pulls out a magnifying glass from his back pocket and focuses the beam on Woody's forehead. (as Interrogator) Where are your rebel friends now? Heh, heh. bright white hot dot forms on Woody's forehead and begins to smolder. ' (..) Sid!! Your pop-tarts are ready! Sid pulls the magnifying glass away. Alright!! Sid runs out of the room. As soon as he's gone, Woody jumps up , his forehead burning. He runs to a bowl of half-eaten cereal (with milk) on the floor, and dunks his head in. Buzz runs over to Woody, pausing to remove two suction cup darts from his person before pulling Woody out of the bowl. Two colorful Froot-Loops stick to each of Woody's eyes like glasses. Are you alright? (whacking him on the back) 'm proud of you, Sheriff. lesser man would have talked under such torture. Woody looks at his reflection in the back of the cereal spoon and rubs the burn mark on his forehead. sure hope this isn't permanent. (checking his wrist communicator) Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport -- Woody's eyes light up. : Sid's bedroom door can be seen in the reflection. It's open. The door! It's open! We're free!! Woody runs for the door. Buzz follows. Woody, we don't know what's out there! 'll tell you what's -- ! suddenly appear and block their path to the doorway. Woody hides behind Buzz. They're gonna eat us, Buzz!! Do something! Quick! Shield your eyes! Buzz fires his laser at them. The little red beam just flickers against Babyface's head. The mutant toys look confusedly at each other. It's not working. recharged it before left. It should be good for hours -- Oh, you idiot! You're a toy! Use your karate chop action! Grabbing Buzz like a hostage, Woody fends off the mutant toys by pushing a large button on Buzz's back, making Buzz's arm involuntarily ""chop"" up and down. (to mutants) Get away! Hoo-cha! Hoo-cha! Hey!! Hey! How are you doing that? Stop that! Back! Back, you savages! Back! Woody circles around the mutant toys to the open doorway, continually chopping Buzz's arm. Woody, stop it!! Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled! Woody drops Buzz and runs out the door. . - Woody races down the corridor... (to himself) There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no place like home... ...turns onto the top of the stairwell, down a few steps, and is confronted by... asleep on the landing. Woody freezes inches away from the sleeping beast. He slowly backs up the stairs. Suddenly Buzz appears and pulls Woody back against the hallway wall. He covers Woody's mouth with his hand. (muffled gasp) (whisper) Another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed. (pulling Buzz's hand away) Don't tell me what to do! Shhh! Buzz checks to make sure Scud is still asleep and then darts across the stairwell opening to the other end of the hallway. Once safely across, he motions for Woody to follow. Woody cowardly crawls on all fours across the open area and meets up with Buzz. As he stands... ' gets caught on one of the curls of the wrought iron railing. The toys begin to creep down the hallway, unaware that Woody's pullstring is being pulled farther and farther until -- It off the iron railing and flies back towards Woody. ( ) -!! Both Buzz and Woody leap in surprise at the sound of Woody's voice box. : ' It opens. Woody vainly attempts to stifle the recoiling pullstring. ( ) (continued) Giddy-up partner!... , Scud starts up the stairs. ( ) (continued) ...We got to get this wagon train a movin'! Woody and Buzz take off running. Split up! Two doors are ajar at the other end of the hallway. Buzz dives behind one while Woody jumps into... Woody slams the door shut just as Scud reaches the top of the landing. can be heard from behind the closet door, getting Scud's attention. Buzz peeks out from his doorway at Scud at the closet. Sensing movement behind him, Scud whips around and starts to enter Buzz's doorway. : The noise stops the dog in his tracks. Both Scud and Buzz look up to see... . ' ' - . is asleep on a La--Boy recliner in front of the .. Scud backs out and heads down the stairs. Buzz turns to exit the room when he hears... (..; ) Calling Buzz Lightyear!! Come in Buzz Lightyear!! This is Star Command. Buzz Lightyear! Do you read me?! Star Command! Buzz opens up his wrist communicator and is just about to speak into it when he is interrupted. #1 (..) Buzz Lightyear responding! Read you loud and clear! Buzz turns around to see... Buzz's space ranger logo is on the screen over a field of stars. The image quickly changes to two young boys playing in their backyard with a Buzz Lightyear doll. Buzz Lightyear, Planet Earth needs your help! #1 (into toy wrist communicator) On the way! (..) !!! Buzz reacts with confusion at what he is watching. He walks slowly towards the television set. (..) The world's greatest superhero! Now the world's greatest ! : The Buzz Lightyear doll is now out of the box and being displayed. (..) Buzz has it all! Locking wrist communicator! #1 Calling Buzz Lightyear. (..) Karate chop action! #2 Wow! With every feature demonstrated on the , Buzz compares the same feature on himself. (..) Pulsating laserlight! #2 Total annihilation! (..) Multi-phrase voice simulator!

To Infinity and Beyond! On the screen, the Buzz Lightyear action figure appears to be launched through the air. The words: flash across the bottom of the screen. (..) (non-excited lawyer voice) Not a flying toy. Buzz slowly shakes his head in wide-eyed disbelief. (..) Get your Buzz Lightyear action figure and save a galaxy near you! (..) !!! The image on the screen changes to a shot of hundreds of Buzzes in their boxes lining either side of a store aisle. (..) Available at all Al's Toy Barn outlets in the tri-county area. Buzz is stricken. He looks down at his wrist communicator and opens it. : Molded on the underside of the cover are three words: "" ."" : "" "" . - Buzz walks dejectedly out of the den and down the hallway. As he passes the top of the stairwell he pauses to look up through the railing at... It is open, revealing the blue sky beyond. bird flies past. The taunting voice of Woody echoes in his head. (..) You are a toy! You can't fly! Buzz bows his head, defeated. Slowly Buzz raises his head, determination in his eyes. He slams the offending wrist communicator shut, as if to deny its message of ""Made in Taiwan."" Buzz climbs up the railing to the banister. He pops open his wings, and aims himself towards the window above. To Infinity and Beyond! Buzz leaps off the banister... and falls. In Buzz watches his square of blue sky pull farther away from him as he plummets to the floor below. . ' / - Buzz on the entryway floor. Buzz opens his eyes to see... The broken arm lies a few inches away from his now empty arm socket. Buzz drops his head back in defeat. (..) -o-o-om? Mom, have you seen my Sally doll? Hannah walks into the entryway, and not seeing Buzz, steps on him. (..) What, dear? What was that? Hannah picks up Buzz (and his arm) and smiles. Nevermind. : . - : The knob jiggles for a moment. Suddenly, the door flies open revealing Woody, entangled in Christmas lights, standing atop a pile of boxes to be at doorknob height. Woody and the rest of the junk topple over. bowling ball topples out, smashing Woody square on the head. Oo-o-of! (to the hallway) Buzz?! The coast is clear. Buzz? Where are you? (..; ) It's a secret mission in uncharted space! Let's go!! Woody creeps down the hallway, dragging the Christmas lights with him. (..) Really? That is so-o-o interesting. Woody peeks into the open doorway of... . ' / - Hannah is pretending to have a tea party. Her guests are dolls, headless dolls, that is except for... He is seated at the miniature table, dressed up in a frilly apron and fashionable party hat. (continued) Would you like some tea, Mrs. Nesbit? (under his breath) Buzz! Hannah has placed a tiny teapot in Buzz's severed arm and pours imaginary tea with it. It's so nice you could join us on such late notice. Woody steps back into the hallway. Oh, no! What a lovely hat, Mrs. Nesbit. It goes quite well with your head. Woody thinks for a moment, then takes a few steps further down the hall. He . (high voice) Hannah! Oh, Hannah! Hannah stops pouring tea and looks up. (yelling out her room) Mom? (to the dolls) Please excuse me, ladies. 'll be right back. As soon as Hannah exits the room Buzz keels over face-down onto the table. Hannah passes Woody, hidden in the Christmas lights, and walks downstairs. What is it, Mom? Mom, where are you? Woody bolts into Hannah's room. Buzz! Hey, Buzz! Are you okay? Buzz lifts his head up and wails in drunken despair. Gone! It's all go-o-one! All of it's gone. Bye-bye! Whoo-hoo! See ya! Woody picks up Buzz's severed arm. What happened to you? One minute you're defending the whole galaxy... (pointing at other dolls) ...and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie Antoinette and her little sisters. The headless dolls turn and wave. Woody removes the teapot from the severed arm and sets it on the table. think you've had enough tea for today. (helping Buzz up) Let's get you out of here, Buzz. (grabbing Woody) Don't you get it?! You see the hat? am Mrs. Nesbit!! (hysterical laughter) Snap out of it, Buzz! Woody presses Buzz's helmet open, slaps him across the face with his own detached arm, and then politely closes the helmet. Buzz sobers up and calmly takes his severed arm from Woody. Buzz walks out of the room while Woody follows. (sober) 'm sorry. You're right. . - (continued) ...'m just a little depressed, that's all. can get through this. Buzz reaches the center of the hallway and drops to his knees. Oh, 'm a sham!! (loud whisper) Sh-h-h-h-h!! Quiet, Buzz. Look at me! can't even fly out of a window! Woody stops short. He looks down the hallway in the direction of Sid's room. : ' Woody can see straight out Sid's window across the way to Andy's bedroom window. (continued) But -- the hat looked good. Tell me the hat looked good! The apron is a bit much, it's not my color... Out the window...Buzz, you're a genius! Woody grabs the coil of Christmas lights and drags Buzz towards Sid's room. (continued) Come on, this way! Years of Academy training...wasted!! . ' /' Mr. Potato Head and Hamm are playing Battleship. Hamm's wearing Potato Head's hat. . -3. Miss. -6. . Ohhh! You sunk it!

' - Slinky, Bo Peep and Rex look to the window. Woody?! You're kidding? Woody?! . ' We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz? Buzz is not there. Woody looks down at the floor. Buzz is sitting on the floor, playing ""bombs away"" with his broken arm. . ' /' The rest of Andy's toys gather around the window to see Woody. Hey, look! Woody! Boy, am glad to see you guys! knew you'd come back, Woody! What are you doing over there? It's a long story, Bo. 'll explain later. Here, catch this! Woody tosses one end of the Christmas lights over. Slinky catches them. got it, Woody! (overly excited) He got it, Woody! Good going, Slink! Now, just, just tie it on to something! . Wait! Wait! got a better idea! How about we '?! Potato Head grabs the string of lights away from Slinky. Hey?!! Potato Head!? . Did you all take stupid pills this morning?! Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz? And now you want to let him back over here? No, no, no! You got it all wrong, Potato Head. Buzz is fine! Buzz is right here. He's with me! . You are a liar! No, 'm not! (to Buzz) Buzz, come over here and you just tell the nice toys that you're not dead. : He doesn't respond, preoccupied with peeling off the sticker on his wrist communicator. He crumples it up and tosses it aside. (to Andy's toys) Just a sec. . ' - Frantic, Woody walks over to the edge of the desk. Buzz! Will you get up here and give me a hand?! Buzz's severed arm comes flying into view and lands by Woody's feet. (insincerely) Ha ha. That's very funny, Buzz. (exploding) This is serious!! (..) Hey, Woody!? Where'd ya go? . (..) He's lyin'. Buzz ain't there. . ' /' Woody reappears at the edge of Sid's window. He pretends to notice something out of the other toy's view. (forced casualness) Oh, hi Buzz! Why don't you say ""hello"" to the guys over there? ' suddenly appears with Woody holding the end just out of sight. Woody throws his voice, pretending to be Buzz. ( ) Hi ya, fellas. To infinity and beyond! Hey look! It's Buzz! (shaking the arm's hand) Yeah, hey Buzz. Let's show the guys our new secret best-friends hand shake. Gimme five, man! Something's screwy here. So, you see? We're friends now, guys. Aren't we, Buzz? (as ) You bet. Gimme a hug. Woody makes Buzz's arm grab his neck and pull him forward. (continued; as himself) Ha, ha, oh, love you, too. See? It is Buzz. Now give back the lights, Potato Head. . Wait just a minute. What are you trying to pull?! Nothing. Woody innocently shrugs and throws both his hands up... ...exposing the severed arm. The toys all in horror. Rex clasps his hands to his mouth and turns away to . Realizing his mistake, Woody tries to hide the arm, but it's too late. Oh, that is disgusting. . Murderer! No! No, no, no, no! . You murdering dog! No, it's not what you think, swear! . Save it for the jury. hope Sid pulls your voice-box out, ya creep! Potato Head drops the lights. No! No! Don't leave! Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please! You don't know what it's like over here! . (to the other toys) Come on. Let's get out of here. Go back to your lives, citizens. Show's over. All the toys leave the window except Slinky. Come back! Slink! Slink, please! Please! Listen to me! Unable to look Woody in the eye, Slinky closes the blinds. (continued) No! No! Come back! ---!! : As storm clouds roll over Sid's house, Woody slumps over the window sill in defeat. . ' - emit from behind Woody. He turns from the window to see... converging all around Buzz. !! Still holding onto Buzz's arm, Woody jumps down from the desk and runs to Buzz's rescue. Go away, you disgusting freaks! Babyface turns from the fray and charges at Woody with his erector-set pinchers. Woody cowers, shielding himself from Buzz's arm. Babyface clamps onto the arm and has a tug-o-war with Woody. Alright back! Back, you cannibals! Woody loses his grip on the arm and sails across the room, crashing into the wall. By now there is no sight of Buzz within the swarming mass of mutant toys. Woody attacks the mob with a vengeance. He is still alive, and you're not gonna get him, you monsters! He furiously throws the mutant toys aside, digging his way to... He is sitting up, his broken arm now newly-attached. Woody's anger turns to confusion. Hey?! Hey, they fixed you! Woody shakes Buzz's arm to confirm what he's seeing is real when he looks to the mutants. (continued) But -- but they're cannibals. We saw them eat those other toys. The mutant toys part to reveal the recent victims of Sid's last ""operation"": The Janie Doll and Pterodactyl. Their heads have been taped back on the correct bodies. The mutants all innocently stare at Woody. Uh...sorry. ... thought that you were gonna... (laughs nervously) ...you know, eat my friend. Immediately, the mutant toys retreat back into the dark corners of the room. Hey! No, no, wait! Hey! What's wrong? ' (..) Sid! (..) Not now, Mom, 'm ! Sid!!! approach the bedroom. Woody tries to pick up the still depressed Buzz, but he just goes limp. Buzz! 'mon, get up! Buzz, you're... () ...get up... Woody begins dragging Buzz towards the bed, but their progress is too slow. He shakes Buzz hard. Fine. Let Sid trash you. But don't blame me. Woody leaves Buzz sitting alone in the middle of the floor and hides underneath a nearby milkcrate just as... Sid enters carrying a big box. It came! It finally came! Sid runs over to his workbench and rips open the box. (reverently) The big one. He pulls out a rocket with "" "" written on it. (reading the rocket label) ""Extremely dangerous. Keep out of reach of children."" ... (looks around) What am gonna blow? Man...hey, where's that wimpy cowboy doll? Sid spots the milkcrate and picks it up. No Woody. : Out of Sid's view, Woody presses against the inside, hanging on for dear life. : ' Sid looks down and notices he's stepping on Buzz, activating his laser. Yes! 've always wanted to put a spaceman into orbit. Ha-ha. He places Buzz and the milkcrate on the workbench and throws a toolbox on top of the crate. The impact of the toolbox dislodges Woody from his hiding place. Woody quickly ducks under a magazine on the floor of the crate ""jail."" Woody watches helplessly as Sid fishes out a roll of electrical tape from the toolbox and, with an , tapes Buzz to the rocket. : flash of lightning interrupts the moment. Oh, no... Sid crosses to the window to see a huge rainstorm commence. Sullenly, he smacks his head against the window. Aw, man...! Woody heaves a of relief. Suddenly Sid's face brightens. He turns his focus from the rain to the Buzzrocket. (as Newscaster) Sid Phillips reporting. Launch of the shuttle has been delayed due to adverse weather conditions at the launch site. Tomorrow's forecast... Sid smacks Buzz down on the desk, winds his alarm clock, and places it next to Buzz. Sunny. Ha-ha-ha. Sweet dreams. . ' - Andy is being tucked into bed by his mother. She hands him his cowboy hat. . looked everywhere, honey, but all could find was your hat. (groggy) But what if we leave them behind? . Oh, don't worry, honey, 'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz before we leave tomorrow. Andy's eyes shut. Mom turns out the light and quietly exits the room. moving box on the floor, with the words ""Andy's Toys!"" scrawled on it, begins to shake from side to side. (..) (muffled) Aaaah! need air! Rex pops out of the top of the box, a packing styrofoam peanut out of his mouth. Potato Head appears beside him. (relieved) Aa-a-a-a-ah! () . Will you quit moving around?! 'm sorry. It's just that get so nervous before travel. . How did get stuck with as a moving buddy? Potato Head drops back down into the box. (following Potato Head) Everyone else was picked. peeks around the corner of one of the boxes and looks up at Andy fast asleep clutching his cowboy hat. Oh, Woody, if only you could see how much Andy misses you. . ' - as rain pours down outside the spooky dwelling. . ' Sid is in bed fast asleep. Woody struggles to move his milkcrate jail, but with the weight of the toolbox on top it won't budge. Woody looks across the desktop at Buzz sitting dejectedly with the rocket strapped to his back. Ps-s-s-s-t! Psst! Hey, Buzz! No reaction from Buzz. Woody picks up a stray washer from the desktop and flings it at Buzz, striking his helmet. Buzz lifts his head and turns lifelessly to look at Woody. Hey! Get over here and see if you can get this tool box off me. Buzz just looks away from Woody and bows his head. Oh, come on, Buzz. ...Buzz, can't do this without you. need your help. can't help. can't help anyone. Why, sure you can, Buzz. You can get me out of here and then 'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house. Andy's house. Sid's house. What's the difference. Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly. No, Woody, for the first time am thinking clearly. (looking at himself) You were right all along. 'm not a Space Ranger. 'm just a toy. stupid little insignificant toy. Whoa, hey -- wait a minute. Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger. Yeah, right. No, it is. Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a ! You are toy. But why would Andy want me? Why would Andy want you?! Look at you! You're a Buzz Lightyear. Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you. You've got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that -- that whoosh thing -- you are a toy. Woody pauses and looks at himself. (continued; depressed) As a matter of fact you're too cool. mean -- mean what chance does a toy like me have against a Buzz Lightyear action figure? All can do is... Woody pulls his own pull-string. ( ) There's a snake in my boots! Woody bows his head. Why would Andy ever want to play with me, when he's got you? (pause) 'm the one that should be strapped to that rocket. Woody slumps dejectedly against the crate, his back to Buzz. Buzz lifts up his foot. : ' The signature """" reads through the dirt and scuff marks. Buzz gazes back at Woody. look of determination spreads across his face. Listen Buzz, forget about me. You should get out of here while you can. Silence. Woody turns around. Buzz is gone. Suddenly, the entire milkcrate begins to shake. Woody looks up to see... He is on top of the milkcrate, trying to push the tool box off. Buzz!! What are you doing? thought you were -- Come on, Sheriff. There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing. Yes Sir! Both Buzz and Woody push the milkcrate and together, they finally get it to move but it's slow progress. (strained) Come on, Buzz! We can do it! : The two toys stop to look out the window by the workbench. : ' With the rain stopped and the sun beginning to rise... can be seen pulling up in front of Andy's house. Woody! It's the moving van. We've got to get out of here.... Buzz braces himself between the tool chest and the wall. Using his legs, Buzz pushes with all his might. The toolbox begins to move. Woody notices that with every shove Buzz gives to the tool chest, the milkcrate begins to edge out over the lip of the desk. 'mon, Buzz. Finally the gap is wide enough for Woody to jump through. Woody drops down to the floor below. (loud whisper) Alright. Buzz! Hey! 'm out! Buzz doesn't hear Woody and continues to shove the toolbox (and milkcrate) farther out. ...almost () ...there () ... Woody looks up just in time to see the entire toolbox and milkcrate topple towards him. (nervous laugh) The toolbox right on top of Woody. Buzz falls onto the desktop and glances over to Sid, who stirs... (in his sleep) wanna ride the pony... Sid does not wake. Buzz heaves a , then peers over the edge of the workbench. Woody! Woody?! Are you alright?! Woody lifts himself out from under the rubble. (punch-drunk) No, 'm fine...'m okay... : It goes off by Sid's bed. Woody drops back under the toolbox and Buzz goes limp. Sid groggily sits up for a beat, then his eyes light up. Oh, yeah! Time for lift-off! Sid jumps out of bed, grabs Buzz and bolts out of the room. (..) !! Woody leaps to his feet, runs across the room, and catches the door just before it closes. As he swings the door back open Woody is confronted by... The dog barrels down the hallway straight for Woody. Aaah! Back! Back! Down! Down! Woody slams the door shut just in time. Scud at the door. (out of breath; to himself) Okay, what do do? Come on Woody, think! Woody looks across the room. have appeared all around the room. Guys! The mutant toys all scatter and hide. No, no, no! Wait! Wait! Listen! Please! There's a good toy down there and he's -- he's going to be blown to bits in a few minutes all because of me. 've gotta save him! (pause) -- But need your help. No response. Woody then notices Babyface timidly peeking out of the shadows from under the bed. Please. He's my friend. He's the only one 've got. Babyface crawls out and bangs in code on the side of Sid's metal bedpost. The mutant toys emerge from the shadows, and gather around Woody. He kneels down into a huddle with them. (to Babyface) Thank you. (to the others) Okay. think know what to do. We're going to have to break a few rules, but if it works, it'll help everybody. .

Legs and , a duck head Pez dispenser with baby doll torso and plunger base, rush over to a heating grate and pull the face plate off the wall. They disappear into the heating duct. . - Ducky and Legs come to an intersection. Ducky and they head down the right tunnel. .

Ducky takes the end of the line off Legs' fishing reel, hooks it onto himself, and is then lowered down through the open hole. . - Hanging halfway down the front door, Ducky begins to swing. Eventually he swings far enough to reach his destination: the doorbell. Ducky presses it. : . ' Woody throws his arm down. Go!! Hand-in-the-box throws open the door and The Frog is let loose. The Frog zips through Scud's legs and down the hallway. Scud chases after it and follows it down the stairs. : (..) 'll get it! Woody helps the rest of the mutant toys onto the skateboard. Alright, let's go. Using his front arms, Rollerbob propels the skateboard and crew out into the hallway. . ' / : Hannah walks to the front door... 'm coming!

The Frog leaps off the last step, speeds through Hannah's legs and out the open front door. Hannah looks back inside at Scud. In that moment, Ducky catches the Frog and is quickly reeled upwards back into the roof. Scud bursts through Hannah's legs, knocking her over, and runs out onto the empty porch. (annoyed) !!! Scud suddenly realizes he's been duped, but before he can get back inside, Hannah slams the front door shut. Stupid dog. Scud smashes into the closed door and begins furiously. As Hannah storms off into another room she doesn't notice Woody and the mutants zipping off the stairs and round the corner, heading straight into the kitchen. . - By now RollerBob has really picked up speed. He shoots underneath the kitchen table, through the maze of chair legs, straight towards... Lean back! The mutants all push back causing the RollerBob to do a wheelie. They smash through the doggie door... . ' - ...and catapult into the bushes. The toys peek out from the bush to see Buzz strapped to the launchpad. Sid is still in the toolshed.

Countdown will commence momentarily. Stand by -- (simulated static) Ducky, Legs, and the Frog shoot out into the yard from a drain pipe. They exchange a thumbs-up with Woody. (to toys in the bush) Let's go! The mutants disperse to their designated places in the yard. (..) Hey, Mom?! Where are the matches? Oh, oh, wait, here they are. Nevermind... Woody runs towards Buzz, who spots Woody approaching. (loud whisper) Woody?! Great! Help me out of this thing! Woody stops a few feet away from Buzz. Shhhhhhh! What?! (loud whisper) It's ok. Everything's under control. Woody deliberately falls down limp on the grass. Woody?! What are you doing?! Sid emerges from the tool shed. Buzz freezes. ( ) Houston, all systems are go. Requesting permission to launch -- (spotting Woody) Hey! How'd you get out here? Sid picks up Woody, examines him for a beat and then smiles. Oh, well, you and can have a cookout later. Ha-ha-ha... He sticks a match prominently in Woody's holster and tosses him onto the grill of an open barbecue. ( ) Houston, do we have permission to launch? -- (simulated static) Uh, Roger, permission granted. You are confirmed at minus 10 seconds... During Sid's countdown, all the mutants scurry into their final positions. Sid lights a match. (continued) ...and counting. Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven! Six! Five! Four! Three! Two!... One!... Sid grins menacingly as the match moves towards the fuse. ( ) Reach for the sky!! Huh? Sid pulls back from lighting the fuse. He turns to look at Woody still lying lifelessly atop the barbecue except for the sound emitting from his voice box. ( ) This town ain't big enough for the two of us! What?! Sid walks over to Woody and picks him up. ( ) Somebody's poisoned the water hole... It's busted. He raises Woody up, about to throw him away -- ( ) Who are you callin' busted, Buster?!

The remains of broken toys in the yard, led by the bedroom mutants, begin rising from the ground in "" "" fashion. The toys march forward, forming a circle around Sid. Sid is too frightened to scream or move. ( ) From now on, you must take good care of your toys. Because if you don't, we'll find out, Sid. We toys can see...

Hannah chases after him, taunting. What's wrong, Sid?! Don't you want to play with Sally?! . ' The toys are all congratulating one another. Nice work, fellahs. Good job. Comin' out of the ground -- what a touch! That was a stroke of genius. Woody! Woody turns around and looks at Buzz, who's still affixed to Sid's launchpad. Buzz extends his hand to Woody. Thanks. They shake. : . (..) Everybody say, ""Bye, house."" (..) (depressed) Bye, house. Buzz and Woody look in the direction of Andy's house. : ' - Through the fence, Andy and his family can be seen getting into the van. Woody! The van! Woody quickly hoists Buzz off the pole he was tied to. (to mutant toys) We gotta run! Thanks, guys. With the rocket still taped to Buzz, the two toys sprint towards the fence. : Quick! Woody easily slips through the slats in the fence, but Buzz's rocket causes him to become stuck. . ' - Woody has climbed up on to the rear bumper of the van before realizing that Buzz is missing. He looks back to discover Buzz stuck in the fence. Just go! 'll catch up! Woody jumps down and runs back for Buzz. The van begins pulling out of the driveway.

Woody then lunges for the strap but it stays just out of reach. You can do it, Woody. Woody gives a mighty leap and catches hold of the strap. Whew, made it! Woody begins climbing up when suddenly Buzz goes pale. Woody looks behind him to see... The dog leaps forward and bites down on one of Woody's legs. (kicking Scud with other foot) Aaaaaahh!! Get away, you stupid dog! Down! Down! Scud tugs on Woody, pulling him down to the end of the strap. Hold on, Woody! can't do it! Take care of Andy for me! ------!!

The moving truck continues down the street leaving Buzz and Scud behind. Still hanging onto the strap, Woody scrambles up onto the bumper. He unlocks the back door of the truck and tries to lift up the heavy door. Suddenly, the family van and moving truck come to a stop at a traffic light. Woody slams into the door, causing it to fly upward taking Woody with it. Hanging from the door, Woody scans the inside of the truck until he spots what he's looking for. with the words ""' "" written on them in crayon. . Scud flings Buzz off his face. Buzz goes tumbling under a parked car. Scud runs over to the car, but is too big to get under it. . Woody rips into one of Andy's boxes. : All the toys wince and as they cover their eyes from the sudden brightness. What?! Are we there already? Woody?! How'd you -- Woody's response is to slide the box aside and begin rummaging through the next box. Slinky, Potato Head, Rex and the other toys as they poke their heads up out of the first box. Ah-hah! There you are!! Woody pulls the Car and its remote out of the second box. . Hey! What's he doing? Woody runs to the back of the truck and throws the Car out onto the street. The other toys in horror.

Buzz and the car drive straight into it. Scud blindly follows them into the traffic and skids to a halt just missing a car. The car swerves and into another car. Soon there is a multi-car pile up that encircles Scud, entrapping the dog. Buzz and the car emerge from the intersection safely on the other side. . The mob of toys lift up Woody (still holding the remote) and head for the open back. No wait! You don't understand! Buzz is out there! We've gotta help him!! . Toss 'im overboard! No, no, no, wait!

Potato Head and Rex grabs on to Slinky's tail allowing Slinky's front end to jump off the truck and onto the ramp. Slinky leans forward with his paw outstretched to Woody.

Woody pulls out the match from his holster that Sid had put there earlier. (continued) Yes! Thank you, Sid! Woody runs around behind Buzz, strikes the match against 's back tire, and is about to light the fuse when... whizzes right over them, blowing out the match. Woody clenches the burnt match in his hands and falls prostrate to the ground. No-o-o! No-no-no-no! No-o-o! Unable to watch a cowboy cry, Buzz bows his head, causing his helmet to block the sun from Woody. As Buzz's shadow passes over him, Woody stops whimpering and looks at his hand. like the one generated from Sid's magnifying glass, appears on the back of Woody's hand. Woody leaps up, grabs Buzz's helmet and aligns it so the white dot hits the tip of the fuse. Woody?! What are you doing? Hold still, Buzz! The fuse lights. Ha-ha!! You did it! Next stop. Andy.

Sorry. was a little vague on the details. So where are you going? Well, you see my son was taken. My son was taken away from me. [gasp] No way. What happened? No, no, no, kids. don't wanna talk about it. Awww! Please? Pleeeease? [sighs] Well, okay. live on this reef, a long long way from here. Oh, boy. This is gonna be good, can tell. And my son, Nemo, see he was mad at me. And maybe he wouldn't have done it if hadn't been so tough on him, don't know. Anyway, he swam out in the open water to this boat and when he was out there, these divers appeared and tried to stop them but the boat was too fast. So we swam out in the ocean to follow them... They couldn't stop them. And then Nemo's dad, he swims out to the ocean and they bump into.. ..three ferocious sharks! He scares away the sharks by blowin' them up! Golly, that's amazing! And then dives thousands of.. ..feet straight down into the dark. It's like wicked dark down there, you can see a thing. How's it goin', Bob? And the only thing that they can see down there.. ..is the light from this big horrible creature with razor sharp teeth. Nice parry, old man. And then he has to blast his way... So, these two little fish have been..searching the ocean for days. On the East Australian Current. Which means that he may be on his way here right now. That should put them in Sydney.. 1 ..Harbor in a matter of days. mean, it sounds like this guy's gonna stop at.. 36 2 ..nothing until he finds his son. sure hope he makes it. 3 That's one dedicated father if you ask me. Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Oh, would you just shut up! You're rats with wings! ..bloke's been lookin' for his boy Nemo. Nemo? He was taken off the reef by divers and this..

It's okay, know who you're talking about. Gill? Gill? Hey, Sharkbait. 'm sorry couldn't stop the-- No, 'm the one who should be sorry. was so ready to get out, so ready to taste that ocean. was willing to put you in harm's way to get there. Nothing should be worth that. 'm sorry couldn't get you back to your father, kid. All right! Hey, hey, hey, hey--! 37 What the!? !!! Oooooh... Well, uh, that's one way to pull a tooth.

My father? Really? Really? Oh yeah. He's travelled hundreds of miles. He's been battling sharks and jellyfish and all sorts of-- Sharks? That can't be him. Are you sure? What was his name? Some sort of sportfish or something: tuna, uh, trout.. Marlin? That's it! Marlin! The little clownfish from the reef. It's my dad! He took on a shark! heard he took on three. // Three!? Three sharks!? That's gotta be forty eight hundred teeth! You see, kid, after you were taken by diver Dan over there, your dad followed the boat you were on like a maniac. Really? He's swimming and he's swimming and he's giving it all he's got and then three gigantic sharks capture him and he blows them up! And then dives thousands of feet and gets chased by a monster with huge teeth! He ties this demon to a rock and what does he get for a reward? He gets to battle an entire jellyfish forest! And now he's riding with a bunch of sea turtles on the East Australian Current and the word is he's headed this way right now, to Sydney! 38 Wow! Ha ha ha! Oh, what a good daddy!

So, Mr. Incredible...do you have a secret identity? . Every superhero has a secret identity. don't know a single one who doesn't. Who wants the pressure of being super all the time?

In a stunning turn of events, a superhero is being sued for saving someone who, apparently, didn't want to be saved. The plaintiff, Oliver Sansweet, who was foiled in his attempted suicide by Mr. Incredible, has filed suit against the famed superhero in Superior Court. ' Mr. Sansweet didn't ask to be saved. Mr. Sansweet didn't want to be saved. And the injury received from Mr. Incredible ''actions'', so quote, causes him daily pain. (. ) Hey, saved your life! You didn't save my life! You ruined my death, that's what you did! (. ) Listen-- . ' My client has no further comment at this time. Five days later, another suit was filed by victims of the el train accident. Incredible's court losses cost the government millions. And opened the flood gates for dozens of superhero lawsuits the world over. It is time for their secret identity to become their only identity. Time for them to join us, or go away. Under tremendous public pressure, and the crushing financial burden of an ever mounting series of lawsuits, the government quietly initiated the superhero relocation program. The supers will be granted amnesty from responsibility for past actions, in exchange for the promise to never again resume hero work. Where are they now? They are living among us. Average citizens, average heroes. Quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world a better place. __________________________________________SCENE 6__________________________________________ style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>(15 ) .

Maybe could, if you'd let me go out for sports. Honey, you know why we can't do that. promise 'll slow up. 'll only be the best by a tiny bit. Dashiell Robert Parr, you are an incredibly competitive boy. And a bit of a showoff. The last thing you need is temptation. You always say, ''Do your best.'' But you don't really mean it. Why can't do the best that can do? Right now, honey, the world just wants us to fit in, and to fit in, we just gotta be like everybody else. Dad always said our powers were nothing to be ashamed of.

Protecting people. Nobody asked us. You need an invitation? 'd like one, yes. We keep sneaking out to do this, and...you remember Gazerbeam? Yeah. There was something about him in the paper. He had trouble adjusting to civilian life, too. When's the last time you saw him? don't see anyone from the old days, Bob. Just you. And we're pushing our luck as it is. Oh, come on. It was fun the first time, but if we keep doing this, we're gonna get-- We have a report on a fire... fire. We're close! [yelling] Yeah, baby! We're gonna get caught. Woohoo! Haha! Fire! Yeah!

Tell me you haven't been listening to the police scanner again? Look, performed a public service. You act like that's a bad thing. It is a bad thing, Bob! Uprooting our family again, so you can relive the glory days is a very bad thing. Reliving the glory days is better than acting like they didn't happen! Yes! They happened! But this, our family, is what's happening now, Bob. And you are missing this! can't believe you don't want to go to your own son's graduation. It's not a graduation. He's moving from the fourth grade to the fifth grade. It's a ceremony! It's psychotic! They keep creating new ways to celebrate mediocrity but if someone is genuinely exceptional... This is not about you, Bob. This is about Dash. You want to do something for Dash? Then let him actually compete. Let him go out for sports! will not be made the enemy here! You know why we can't do that. Because he'd be great! This is not about you! All right, Dash. know you're listening. Come on out. Vi? You, too, young lady. Come on. Come on out. It's okay, kids.

Lady Bird waits her turn to make her speech, and makes eye contact with Julie in the crowd, a sweet, chubby 17 year old. Her best friend. 5 classrooms, 5 syllabi, 5 “beginning of senior year” speeches from the teachers. few teachers are nuns. - There are the classics: St. Augustine, of course, and Aquinas. My favorite, Kierkegaard - wait until you hear his love story - it will make you swoon. Back in the church, Lady Bird looks intently at an image of Jesus. The priest gives his homily. We’re afraid we won’t get into the college of our choice, we’re afraid we won’t be loved, we won’t be liked, we won’t succeed. Everyone takes communion. Lady Bird approaches and crosses her arms so she just gets a blessing, not real communion, she’s not Catholic. Lady Bird watches the boys get communion. It’s somehow sexy, opening their mouths to receive the wafer. - (..) Some of the students were disturbed by your posters. 6. . - -’ . . Sister Sarah-Joan, in a traditional habit, holds up some of Lady Bird’s campaign materials. It’s just a bird head on a lady body or vice versa. - think it’s a little upsetting... Reveal of the poster: Lady Bird’s head on a bird body. Another shows her Catholic-uniformed body with a bird head. It’s my tradition to run for office. Don’t worry, won’t win. - That’s not what ’m worried about. (worried) This won’t mess with my scholarship, will it? - No, you’re okay there. (trying to be helpful) You have a performative streak, think. think that too. - Maybe you’d enjoy theatre arts... They are having auditions for the fall musical. Do we have that here? - It’s a collaborative effort with the men at Xavier. How am a senior and not know we have that? 7. - Perhaps you haven’t always been an active part of this community. - They do a fall musical and a spring play and from what hear it’s a real blast. What ’d really like is to be on Math Olympiad. - (gently) But math isn’t something that you are terribly strong in? That we know of . . Sign ups for auditions for the fall musical. hand reaches up and takes the pen attached and writes, in all caps: “ ” McPHERSON And then another hand reaches up and writes: “” (..) “Julie” doesn’t need to be in quotes. (..) But it’s not my real name. Reveal Julie and Lady Bird debating this: It’s not the same thing. (shaking her head) ’m not sure you’re right... 8. . . . Julie and Lady Bird walk through the “fancy” neighborhood, “The Fabulous Forties.” They stop in front of this very specific house - it is the Dream House: It is three stories and blue, with white shutters and a big American Flag. It looks like nothing bad would ever happen in this house. love this neighborhood. Yeah, it’s so beautiful. If lived here would definitely have my wedding in the backyard. ’d have friends over all the time to study and eat snacks. ’d be like “ ’ .” ’d have my own bathroom. . . . Julie and Lady Bird browse magazines in an empty checkout aisle. Checker calls out to them: can’t stop you dicks from hanging out here but quit wrinkling all the magazines! When ’m in this store, ’m not your sister - ’m a customer, Miguel! ’m always right! This is Miguel. Lady Bird’s brother. 22, Latino, clearly adopted. Julie watches him and his girlfriend, Shelly Yuhan, 22, a Bagger: Ever since she moved in, your brother and Shelly are becoming the same person. No way. 9. Shelly and Miguel have the same asymmetrical hair-cut and “interesting” piercings. Vaguely punk looking. Seem like they’re wearing black leather jackets even when they aren’t. (’) Yeah, okay, maybe. (re: magazine) See, why don’t look like that? The girls look at a model in the magazine. She poses in front of the New York City skyline. Just once ’d like to have the song “New York Groove” play and feel like it really applies to my life. You’ve never even been to New York. That’s why ’m applying to New York colleges - do you know if Sarah Lawrence is actually the city? Your parents would pay for that? Scholarships, financial aid. ’ll figure it out. My Mom thinks can’t get in but she is sorely mistaken. What about terrorism? Don’t be a Republican. ’m probably just going to go to City College. (almost yelling) .. . . . Marion yawns. Luis, a large Filipino man, approaches her: 10. You doing okay, mama? Yes, but that was terrifying wasn’t it? Thank god you were there. guess can’t have pencils anymore. Yeah, gotta go back to just felt tip markers. Crayola. Marion suddenly remembers she has something, she hand Luis a small bag: Oh Luis this is for you! got it for the baby, couldn’t resist it. He pulls out a frilly pink dress for a toddler. She loves pink! Well, it’s really more for you and Andrea than it is for the baby, and ’m sorry didn’t have time to wrap it.... No, it’s perfect. See you tomorrow... mean, later? Luis just laughs. . 1994 . . Marion drives back home. It is romantic somehow. She loves these streets, loves the turns she knows so well. When she’s not resenting the stuck-ness of her own life she has an enormous capacity to love it. Remember this moment with Marion. . ’ . . Marion drives up. Women are watering their lawns, getting the paper, doing yard work, touching their flowers. Solidly middle class. Marion waves to neighbors. They wave back. She picks up the mail, bills, papers, etc. 11. . . . Dad (50s, name: Larry) brushes his teeth. Marion perched on the edge of the tub with a newspaper and a stack of mail, going through it. Did you know toothpaste is basically ineffective? It’s like sucking on a mint. (to Larry, shaking her head) Mike Kerry died. didn’t know he was sick again. How old was he? Only fifty-six. Knocking at the door. (..) Can Shelly and get in there? In a minute honey Dad and are still in here! (re: Mike) That’s too young. (calling) ! . (’) ’ll send them a note. (a little softer) Do you think that Shelly and Miguel have sex on the pullout couch? 12. Oh yeah. Marion laughs at Larry’s subtle joke. He laughs at her laughter. They like each other. . . . Miguel and Shelly eat cereal. Larry reads the paper. Marion makes Lady Bird’s breakfast and her lunch. Why can’t just make the eggs? Because you take too long and make a big mess and then have to clean it up. (small voice) Eggs aren’t good for the environment, anyway. (too loud) ? You heard her. (placing the eggs) Here, eat quickly, . (re: paper) Look at all these pictures. Every newspaper looks like Today. Shelly and are trying to be vegan. Hence the soy milk. You wear leather jackets. 13. They’re vintage. It doesn’t support the industry. (poking at the eggs) They aren’t done, there’s white stuff. You know how you love Brambles? Pigs are smarter than him even. never thought Brambles was a okay? (’) (very obnoxious) ! The eggs are ! . Marion then throws the frying pan violently in the sink and retreats to the bathroom. The noisy hair-dryer starts up. ’ ! Lady Bird follows Marion out of the room. Your sister doesn’t like me. (..) !!! ’ ! She does. Shelly gets up, pouting. follows her (..) ! ! 14. Larry is left alone. It’s weirdly peaceful for half a second. . 1994 . . Lady Bird and Larry on the way to school. She feverishly changes the radio station, finds a song she likes: Did you know that Alanis Morisette wrote this song in only ten minutes? believe it. (she smiles) So ’m applying to a couple East Coast schools. need you to help me with the financial aid application but Mom can’t know. We... aren’t they quite expensive? First, yes that’s why financial aid. Second, have to get in first. Mom won’t be happy about it. Which is why don’t want to fight about it before have to. 15. Lady Bird looks up. They are a couple of blocks from school. (’) Just pull over here Are you sure, can drive you to the front -- No, just this is fine. like to walk. Okay, well, love you. So what do you think? About college? ’ll see what can do. (kisses him on the cheek) Thanks Dad, love you too. Have a good day at work. Hey, ’m like Keith Richards “’m just happy to be anywhere.” She gets out quickly and hurries away. She’s almost at school when Julie pulls up. (calling out) Hey bitch! Ms. Pickett has fake breasts. Her boyfriend, Matt, hands a sack lunch to Lady Bird and Julie. Alright girls, hope you like pickles. 16. Thanks, Uncle Matt. Sweet! Ms. Pickett gets in the driver’s seat, they drive away. He’s not your uncle. It’s something ’m trying out. Bye, mom. (watching Ms. Pickett go) Your Mom really likes you. Yeah. just keep getting fatter. Lady Bird starts eating the Matt lunch and chucks her own lunch into a garbage can. The one her Mom spent time making. (’) (mouth full) Me too. Matt is awesome. Yeah, hope he marries my Mom. That would be nice. He promised me his old car when turn eighteen. In the student parking lot, a girl gets out of her fancy Range Rover. She’s pretty in a high school way. That car should be illegal. Jenna Walton’s not doing any off-roading. She just goes to Pavillions. heard Jenna Walton has a tanning bed in her house. The girl, Jenna Walton, is very tan. Identical tan girls descend on her. She is so pretty. Her skin is luminous. Maybe we should try tanning. 17. . . Lady Bird and Julie sit with their legs up the wall, eating communion wafers out of a large plastic container. Yeah, in the tub just scoot myself under like now, like this, and then the water just... She gestures, showing that the water would flow into her crotch and get her off. They are hysterically laughing. We are so gross! think figured it out when was like three or something. use, take off the shower head, oh god this is so embarrassing! use that. don’t know if mine is the right kind, though. Maybe it’s different when you actually have a penis in there, like it’s more intense. Mine is pretty intense, think. Darlene, an odd looking girl, has silently walked in. You’re not supposed to eat the wafers! (trying to be helpful) They aren’t consecrated. Darlene turns on her heel, annoyed. Lady Bird and Julie dissolve into giggles. . - /. . Lady Bird, wearing an extreme “audition” dress, and Julie, in her uniform, sit and watch other students perform. 18. Father Leviatch runs auditions - there is something funny and depressed about him. An overweight woman, Miss Patty, accompanies on the piano when needed. boy, Greg, is up. He has a big voice for such a tiny boy: “ ......!” Cut to Father Leviatch calling out from his clipboard: Okay, Christine? Lady Bird. Is that your given name? Yes. Why is it in quotes? Well gave it to myself. It’s given. To me, by me. , take it away, Lady Bird. Cut to Lady Bird singing her song. “Everybody says don’t / Everybody says don’t / Everybody says don’t it isn’t right, don’t it isn’t niiiiiceeee / Everybody says don’t / Everybody says don’t / Everybody says don’t walk on the grass....” Cut to Julie, wearing her uniform, shy and nervous: (singing) “Make me a channel of your peace / where there’s despair in life let me bring hope / where there is darkness only light / and where there’s sadness ever joy....” Julie has a sweet, clear, beautiful voice. It’s a quiet moment and everyone pays attention. 19. More girls and more boys. Now most everyone is done. Danny stands. He’s very handsome. Strapping, even. He gives his sheet music to the Miss Patty. Then he sings: (singing) “There are giants in the sky! / There are big tall terrible giants in the sky! When you’re way up high and you look below at the world you’ve left and the things you know little than a glance is enough to show you just how small you are!” He’s . Julie and Lady Bird look at each other. . . ’ . . Underneath her window sill by her bed, Lady Bird writes the name: . She’s in love and want to make it permanent somewhere. Suddenly, a voice is directed right at Lady Bird’s door: (..) ! Lady Bird shuts off her light and sleeps, dreaming of Danny. . - /. Lady Bird and Julie check the casting list. They first find: Franklin Shepard: Danny ’Neill, Charlie Kringus: Greg Anrue Gussie: Diana Greenway, Beth: Julie Steffans. They move way down the list until they find: Swing/Chorus: Christine McPherson (tightly) Congratulations. You too! We both got in! 20. Everyone who auditioned got in. The part got was basically not getting in. (trying to downplay) do not even know how got cast in my part. Me neither. was the one who had a dress and prepared a song. know! (thinking) Now you’re going to get romantic with Danny on stage. It’s probably my only shot at that, you know? She take the pen and crosses out Christine and writes . Leaves. Julie stays and when she’s sure she’s alone she touches her name - loving herself and the feeling of being chosen. . . . Marion grocery shops. Lady Bird looks at a magazine. Mom... (re: the magazine) We don’t need to buy that. It’s only three dollars. ’m having a hard week. If you want to read it we can go to the public library. want to read it in bed. 21. That’s something rich people do. We are not rich people. Lady Bird walks away and then tucks the magazine underneath her sweater into the top of her skirt, sneakily stealing it. As she’s performing this maneuver, she sees (!) and his Mom and three little brothers walk by. She walks up bravely: Hey! Hi. Come here often? (not getting the joke) Excuse me? (extending her hand) ’m Lady Bird, we’re going to be in the musical together. Oh, yeah, remember you! You were wearing that dress. just wanted to say what’s up and ’ll see you in rehearsal. Thanks, ’m super excited. You live in the neighborhood? (doing a voice) Nah, ’m from the wrong side of the tracks. What? Is that your family? There are so many of you! Irish-Catholic! It’s hard to find a girl to date that’s not my cousin. 22. (flustered) Well, okay. You’re going to make a great Franklin. Thanks! want my hair, his hair to be curly, though. Yeah! Like Jim Morrison. Very ’70s. Like Jim Morrison exactly. ’ ! Gotta go! Lady Bird walks back to Marion, who is with Miguel while he scans their groceries and Shelly bags them. Who is Jim Morrison again? He was in a rock band, moron, The Doors. knew that. (looking at the bill) This is with your employee discount? Yeah, it’s already included. Marion looks worried. . - /. . Everyone tries to keep up with the dance steps Miss Patty teaches them. She is also, apparently, the choreographer. She can move amazingly well for a bigger woman. 23. They play theatre games and do acting exercises. Father Leviatch is actually quite good at casting a spell and making everyone feel included. : The priest, Father Leviatch, looks around the stage where everyone sits, cross legged, tired from dancing. To get our emotions going, we’re going to play “first one to cry wins.” Starting ... Now. ’m playing too. So is Miss Patty. Miss Patty nods. They all try to cry really hard. Suddenly everyone looks up - Father Leviatch is sobbing. Everyone is uncomfortable watching an adult man cry. ’m sorry… ’m sorry. . - /. . Diana, another girl in the play, dishes the gossip while she and Lady Bird and Danny wait for their rides: heard that before he became a priest he was married and he had a son named Etienne who died of a drug overdose at 17 which was maybe a suicide but my mom says same difference if you are so careless with your life. (a horn honks) Oh that’s her! Gotta go, bye guys! Lady Bird and Danny wave goodbye and then fall into a semi- awkward silence. She sees it’s her Moment. She tries to casually hand Danny a bag but it’s a kind of big bag. 24. Oh, almost forgot. brought you these hot rollers. For your Jim Morrison hair. He pulls out the Conair pink and purple “Hot Sticks.” Thank you so much. You’re welcome. You’ll have to show me how to use them. (weirdly formal) It would be my pleasure. They look like sperms. He laughs and Lady Bird joins in. They do look like sperms but it wasn’t so funny to say it. (’) Hey! just remembered had a dream about you! Really?! What happened? We were flying to Disneyland on a giant carrot.... Awesome! love Disneyland. Me too, think it’s kind of scary but also love it. Triumph! They are having a Real Conversation. . . Mr. Bruno explains a problem on a projector. He’s handsome and young-ish. Definitely handsome for an all girls school. Lady Bird zones out, thinking about Danny. Julie looks intently at Mr. Bruno. She loves him, privately. 25. . (finishing an explanation) Don’t leave me hanging. Can get a nod? That’s good. Maybe even a verbal confirmation? (too loud) . Julie experience her mini moment of private embarrassment. They are handed back quizzes. Julie gets a -. . Good job, Jules, could tell from your work that you even understood the one you missed! He kind of winks at her. She blushes. (looking at her grade) . (to Lady Bird) like “Jules.” Lady Bird looks at her +. just don’t get why ’m not good at math, my Dad is really good at math. Even Miguel has a math degree. Maybe it’s your Mom’s fault. . . . . There are a bunch of kids clumped, some dancing, some sitting on half-hearted hay bales. The popular girls, Jenna etc., wear tank tops that say (front) Ditch the horse... (and back) Ride the cowboy! Lady Bird and Julie now have on bandanas and denim - they’re doing the Groucho Marx Duck Soup dance to “Tha Crossroads.” Suddenly Lady Bird stops. You lose! ! No, look 26. Across the dance, there is Danny. He’s wearing chaps, a holster, a hat, fake pistols. Like teenage John Wayne. (’) Wish me luck. Luck. Julie watches as Lady Bird makes a bee-line for Danny. Wanna dance? Hell, yeah! They start slow dancing together. Julie does the duck-soup dance alone and then stops. It’s pointless without a buddy. She falls back and watches. Sister Sarah-Joan walks by Lady Bird and Danny: - Six inches for the Holy Spirit! They roll their eyes: Rules! Once she leaves Danny pulls Lady Bird close again. She swoons. Life is happening. . . . Lady Bird, Julie and Danny wait outside of the dance, leaning against the gym waiting for their parents. Julie’s Mom pulls up with Uncle Matt. Honks. (to Lady Bird) That’s us! Nah, my Mom is coming. No she’s not. (pointed) Yes, she is. But the plan was sleepover at - ’ . 27. Lady Bird is clearly trying to stay there with Danny. (annoyed) Okay, bye then. Julie gets in the front seat to practice driving. Leaves. Lady Bird and Danny are quiet, listening to the muffled sounds of the dance. Then: Have you ever been out of the country? When was little, my Dad had a job that took him to Brazil. remember from the pictures. ’ve never been out of the country. It’s my dream to go to Paris. (sighs) Paris. That’s why ’m learning French. My mom said French wasn’t useful. It is if you want to go to Paris. They laugh. (’) still don’t know how to use those rollers you gave me. Oh, it’s so easy, like after they heat up, you just take your hair and twist the hair and then twirl the thing like this... She reaches up to his hair. He kisses her. It’s surprising. They kiss again. It’s romantic, really romantic. . . . Lady Bird walks home. She’s smiling so huge and throws her face to the sky and screams. . . . 28. Marion and Larry are arguing with a lot of financial documents strewn across the kitchen table. 29. Larry how long will this hold us. don’t know... Lady Bird opens the back door, glowing and shiny from the night and the kiss. She sneaks past. Well, someone must know. Can the whole family go on Cobra, even Miguel? What happens if someone gets in an accident? ’m not sure - the severance package think it expires all at once, not within the calendar year... Lady Bird tip-toes into her room. She knows she wasn’t supposed to see this. And she doesn’t want to know any more. ’ll ask at my work if -- Suddenly, a noise makes her turn her head sharply. (’) Is she home? Maybe leave it for tonight... No, she knows better. (getting up) She cannot sneak around like this... Marion barrels down the hallway towards Lady Bird’s room. . . . Lady-Bird, under the covers, hears her Mom coming. Then all the lights come on, it’s so bright: Christine! You can’t leave your room like this! didn’t... 30. None of these things were put away right, they aren’t nice, ! ! (weakly) My name is Lady Bird. Don’t lie to me, Christine! Lady Bird sees her Dad pass by the door and give her a look like “’m sorry, can’t help you here.” He disappears. Marion picks up her uniform. , this uniform is going to look like on Monday! (’) This isn’t right - we can’t treat our clothes like this. don’t know what your wealthy friends do... Why do you care what do to my clothes? Marion closes the door.. Your father does not have a job. He lost his job, okay? Do you need him to come in here and explain that to you? 30. Of course he wouldn’t do it anyway, he’s Mr. Nice Guy. always have to be the Bad Guy. Can we please talk about this tomorrow? You can’t look like a rag because that makes us look like rags. And you want to know the truth? Here’s the truth: some of your friends’ fathers could employ your father and they won’t do that if it looks like his family is trash. Lady Bird puts all her clothes away while Marion watches. (quietly) Didn’t you ever go to sleep without putting all your clothes away perfectly? Like even once? And don’t you wish your Mom hadn’t gotten angry? My mother was an abusive alcoholic. Lady Bird has nothing to say to this, Marion wins. . ’ . . Lady Bird looks at some brochures. The Guidance Counselor looks at her grades and test scores. So understand that you’re not interested in any Catholic colleges? No way. Sorry, but yes, no way. 31. Then you’ll be applying to UCs and State schools? Yes, but also those East Coast liberal arts schools. Like Yale, but not Yale because probably couldn’t get in. (laughs) You definitely couldn’t get in. Part of my job is to help you be realistic. That seems like everyone’s job. Your scores are strangely very good. Lady Bird shrugs. (’) ’d placed some calls to local alumni of the schools you’re interested in, but unfortunately all the interviews are taken. So... what does that mean? It means that you’ll have to get in on how you look on paper. . . . The kids rehearse -- following dance moves and singing. . . . Lady Bird and Danny lie on a blanket in the park, looking up at the stars. Shouldn’t we go home? (shakes her head) My Mom is always mad. It doesn’t matter if get home late, she’d be mad at me anyway. 32. Your Mom is hard on you. (defensively) She loves me a lot. (then) Pick a star for us. (pointing) That one, right there right next to the bright one and then the dim one - see it? That’s our star. (’) (whispering) You know you can touch my boobs, right? know... it’s just.... respect you too much for that. Oh, cool, awesome. totally get that. Thank you. You're welcome. 33. If you had boobs wouldn’t touch them either. respect you so much because... love you. love you, too. They kiss and look back up at the stars. Let’s name our star Claude. Lady Bird makes a face. That’s pretentious, don’t you think? It’s French. (then) What should we name it? . They laugh and kiss and yell to the heavens. ! ! They hug and are the happiest they’ve ever been, looking up at the sky and loving each other. 34. (’) (whispers) Bruce. . . . Julie and Lady Bird wander the hallways. Julie shoves a cupcake in her mouth, so does Lady Bird. The wander and chew contemplatively. (not really to anyone) It’s normal to not touch a penis. (looks around, notices everyone is gone) have to go to class. But have free period! need to pass history! think we’re done with the learning portion of high school. ’m gonna go. ! ! Bye, love you. Julie takes off. Lady Bird lazily walks the halls. She sees her empty math classroom and sees that Mr. Bruno isn’t there. She ducks inside. Notices his grade binder on the desk. Snatches it and then runs. She dumps it into one of the big trash cans and hurries away. 35. . . . Marion and Lady Bird are looking through dresses. Did Danny say whether his grandmother has a formal Thanksgiving? don’t know, there are a lot of kids, but she lives in the fab forties... (nodding) Your dad and went to a dinner party once in that neighborhood, the of , and it was pretty formal. Lady Bird finds something - holds up a black dress. (’) You’re not going to a funeral. Well, don’t know! What says “rich people Thanksgiving”? They keep looking. It’s just such a shame that you’re spending your last Thanksgiving with a family you’ve never met instead of us, but guess you want it that way. (clocks her walking) Are you tired? No. saleswoman, Joyce, calls out: Hey Marion! Marion waves to the saleswoman. Her voice is so warm and friendly with other people who are not her daughter: Hey Joyce! How’s the baby! 36. He’s crawling! Ooohhh, want to see a picture at checkout! (back to Lady Bird) If you’re tired we can sit down. ’m not tired! Oh it’s just that couldn’t tell because you’re dragging your feet. (silence) Well, just couldn’t tell. Why didn’t you just say “Pick up your feet.” didn’t know if you were tired. You were being passive aggressive! No. wasn’t. You are so . Please stop yelling. ’m not yelling. Marion sees something. Holds it up. It’s a beautiful old fashioned looking dress. Marion has found the needle in the haystack. (’) Oh it’s perfect! Don’t you love it. 37. . ’ . . Marion, still in her nurses uniform, sits at the sewing machine, tailoring the dress she and Lady Bird found. She finishes, and then hangs it up quietly in Lady Bird’s room. Doesn’t wake her up, simply watches her daughter sleep for a minute. . . . Mr. Bruno addresses his class: . Bruno So because my gradebook has disappeared, am going to count on you to reconstruct it. know you all know your grades better than anybody. have a general idea, but this is all about the honor code right now, okay? They are going up one by one to talk through their grade and he can start again. . Bruno ’m pretty sure it was an . Um, ’m not but okay... . Bruno It was – trust me, know talent when see it. You’re welcome. No, thank you. He does that wink thing at her again. She retreats, red faced. Lady Bird is next: Hey, think . . Bruno thought it was more like - maybe even + territory. No, because did really well on the last quiz... 38. . Bruno seem to remember you doing only slightly better. It brought my average up to a . . Bruno Okay, it is. It’s your honor. . ’ . . Marion, Larry, Shelly and Miguel run around making sure the house is perfect for their Thanksgiving. The doorbell rings. ! ! Marion opens the door, lets in Danny. Hello, Danny! The famous Danny! Aren’t you adorable! (she hugs him) Larry isn’t he adorable? He’s adorable. And you’re driving her and everything - Wow! Thank you for letting Lady Bird come to my Grandmother’s Thanksgiving, Mrs. McPherson. No more politeness, just call me Marion! (firmly shaking Larry’s hand) Nice to meet you, Mr. McPherson. Please, call me Mr. Larry McPherson. 39. (hits him) Larry! Sit down Danny, can get you something to drink? Oh no, ’m fine. (waving) Hi, ’m Miguel. The brother. think Lady Bird wants to make an entrance. She’s mad we don’t have a spiral staircase. (quietly) Shelly. What? Is my name. They’re quiet for a moment. Danny tries to converse: It’s funny, on my way here, went over the train tracks -- You took street? Right, and so just Lady Bird always says that she lives on the wrong side of the tracks, but always thought that it was, like, a metaphor. Ah. But there are actual train tracks. Marion’s face contorts. This is painful. Just then, Lady Bird enters, looking beautiful in her vintage dress. She holds a duffel bag. (now upset with her) What in the hell is in that duffel bag? 40. Don’t worry about it, Jeez! My grandmother will love that dress. . ’ ’ . . Thanksgiving. It is at the Dream House. From the beginning. The blue one with the white trim and the American Flag. Lady Bird cannot believe it. Wait, this is your grandma’s house? Oh my god. She meets his Grandmother, almost kisses her hand like she’s a queen but pulls back just in time: Your house is my favorite in all of East Sacramento. Lady Bird and Danny walk through the house. She spots very prominent Ronald Regan poster: (’) Is this... a joke? No. Lady Bird meets people, so many people, and in a lull, folds a napkin in a cool way - it looks like a four-pointed flower. Danny’s Grandmother notices, and . Soon, Lady Bird is folding all the napkins at the tables this way, teaches her how to do it, too. It is clear how much Danny’s Grandmother enjoys Lady Bird. . ’ . Lady Bird and Danny are singing along with songs from the show. Pick up Julie from her apartment complex. Pick up Greg from his house. Now they’re all singing. In the car, they change out of their Thanksgiving “finery” and put on what they consider to be “people who listen to music in coffee shop” outfits. That was what the duffel was for, the costume change. There are scarves and a beret. . . . In their new outfits, Greg and Danny and Julie and Lady Bird smoke a out of a bowl, which another one of them lights. 41. How do you know when it’s working? 42. You’ll know. It’s not working. It’s not? My sister said this was premium. ’m working. ’m working too. Nope. They are quiet for a second. (’) can’t feel my arms. You’re working. They laugh really hard. Danny makes out with Lady Bird. . . . They hazily take stock of everything. There are some ironic turkeys pinned up on the stage. The “cool kids” are there. They don’t say hi but they don’t shun them. Jenna Walton is there with her boyfriend, Jonah Ruiz. He’s singing pretty terrible songs about her with his band, the pretentiously named ’enfance Nue. (whispered to Julie) If Danny and get married and then his Grandma died, ’d inherit the Dream House. Wouldn’t his parent’s get it? (realizing) Oh yeah, we’d have to kill them. And kill his older brothers, too. 43. Kyle Scheible, a long-haired beautiful bassist, is really into it. Lady Bird spends an extra-long time looking at this Kyle Scheible. She feels to him. She looks at Danny, she loves him, yes, but there is something else going on with Kyle Scheible. She’s not sure, maybe it’s the pot. Maybe not. , Lady Bird will. Meanwhile, Mr. Bruno is there - weird. He looks at Julie, who was looking at him. She turns quickly away. (to no one) Where is Mr. Bruno’s wife...? . ’ . . Lady Bird and Danny stand by the microwave, making “Smart Ones” frozen dinners. Six of them. Greg and Julie also eat, everyone with their own spoon taking bites out of the different platters. Then Marion walks in - they are still giggling, she awkwardly announces herself: How’s it going? No one can say anything, it’s almost like they’re frozen. Finally Lady Bird is able to squeak out: Mom, we really can’t talk right now. They all dissolve into giggles again. Well, Happy Thanksgiving. We missed you, Lady Bird. Marion leaves. She’s hurt and angry but mostly hurt. . ’ . The kids all pile back into Danny’s car. Lady Bird waves goodbye, all of them laughing. Then they are gone. Lady Bird shivers a little, now alone. Startles when she sees Shelly smoking: (curious) Why does that cigarette look so weird? Like not like cigarette? 44. Shelly offers her a drag. Lady Bird drags and coughs. It’s a clove. Lick your lips. That’s why they’re sweet. (then) Your Mom was really sad you weren’t here tonight for Thanksgiving. Well, she hates me. She has a big heart, your Mom. She took me in after my parents freaked out about, whatever, pre-marital sex. admire her. Lady Bird doesn’t fight Shelly. . . . . ` Buzzing in the girls dressing room. It’s opening night! They are putting up pictures and do-dads. They are exchanging “opening night” gifts. The girls are applying too much makeup. There is music playing and lots of screaming. . . . . The boys also get ready. They are putting on powder and combing their hair. It’s less loud, but also kinetic. . - /. . . All the boys and girls are gathered in a circle. Father Leviatch and Miss Patty are leading the prayer. ... (shouts) ! ... 45. ! They break and cheer. It’s time for the show. . - /. . The show is about to begin. The audience sits in the dark. The students in the wings. The paltry orchestra strikes up the first chord. is actually a pretty upsetting and adult show. Julie sings a song about divorce. The other “fabulous” girl, Diana, plays a character who has an affair. There’s lots of pretend drinking of alcohol. They dance and sing their hearts out Everyone cheers at the end, but more about the fact of the show as opposed to the show itself. The audience includes the whole of Lady Bird’s family, Julie’s Mom and Uncle Matt, Danny’s whole Irish-Catholic clan. Everyone is proud. . - /. . Mingling after the show. Some of the administrators look scandalized. Julie sees Mr. Bruno and approaches him, feeling beautiful and confident: . There she is! Jules, wow! You were so good. couldn’t believe that. Thank you... . Jules, ’d like you to meet my wife, Becky. Becky this is Jules, one of my brightest students. Nice to meet you. (devastated) Nice to meet you, too. . How we doing? 46. Yeah, ’m a little tired. . Okay, gotta get her home, we’ve got the little one, but great work Jules. (as they leave) Congratulations. Julie is humiliated, and doesn’t quite know why. She sits down next to Father Leviatch, who also looks traumatized. He watches people pass him by: They didn’t understand it . . . The entire cast and crew is there, enjoying their opening night, eating a lot of chicken fingers and french fries. They are being silly and playing a Broadway trivia game. Lady Bird and Danny make towers with the sugar packets. Julie and Greg hang out together: they’re both the “extra” friends. Everyone is giddy and happy. . . . Julie and Lady Bird wait for the stalls to open up. ! (..) Fuck you. (..) just got my period! Goddamn it! Lady Bird leaves. Where are you going? 47. There’s never a line in the men’s room! . ’ . . Lady Bird opens the door and opens a stall and there, in front of her: Danny and Greg making out hard. Julie comes tumbling in from behind. . ’ . ’ . . They both cry. They listen to “Crash Into Me” by Dave Matthews and sob. The song ends and Lady Bird starts it over. . - /. . They perform the next night. No fun. It’s no fun because their boyfriends are gay. . ’ . . Lady Bird gets her cast off with a saw. Marion watches. The doctor throws the cast in the trash. She is mournful. . . . . Finals. Lady Bird casually cheats off the girl sitting next to her. . . . Everyone gets socks and underwear for Christmas. Even Shelly. They’re really nice socks. They’re expensive, actually. They wick moisture away from your feet. Yeah my feet always have moisture. Mom, love them. 48. (embarrassed) ’m sorry it’s Small Christmas. We wanted to, well, it’s just a little small this year. Larry opens his gift. (laughing) It’s just what needed, honey. He holds up a throw pillow that says “Golfers Don’t Diet They Just Exist On Greens.” He laughs. (laughing, too) It makes me laugh. . ’ . . gentle knock on the door. (..) Dad? Come in. (entering) How did you know it was me? Mom doesn’t knock. (laughs) No, she doesn’t. He gives her an envelope. Quietly says: (’) Here they are, your completed financial aid applications. Merry Christmas. Lady Bird throws her arms around Larry. Thank you! Thank you! Do you need money for the applications? Because can help with that, too, just need to -- 49. -- no, no, ’ve got that, summer jobs covered it. . //’ . . . Lady Bird frantically fills out her applications: addresses things, puts materials in envelopes. This is why we have computer shutoff time - this is our room. He indicates Shelly, looking forlorn by the pullout sofa-bed. Okay, okay, just can you drive me to the post office on ? It should still be open. . . . They are just closing up for the night. Lady Bird runs up and posts them at the last minute. . ’ . . . Lady Bird and her family are out celebrating New Years. Noise makers and sparklers. Happy 2003! Everyone wears the glasses with the zeros for the eyes. . . . This is where she got high the first time and the band played - now Lady Bird learns the cash-register, espresso machine, and then sees Kyle Scheible, that amazing looking bassist, sitting at a table outside, plowing through “The People’s History of the United States.” Later, he steps outside to smoke, she notices and follows: Hey! like your band with Jonah Ruiz, 'enfance Nue? (she pronounces it Lenfance New) (correcting her pronunciation) ’enfance Nue. saw your Thanksgiving show. My name’s Lady Bird. 50. They shake hands. There is something instantly sexual between them. Lady Bird has never felt this thing before. She gets all & songs ever written in one moment. It’s weird you shake hands. Yeah. (lying) Yeah, ’m friends with Jenna and she’s always talking about how great your band is so wanted to check it out. Jenna’s hella tight. Well maybe ’ll see you at the Deuce or something. Sure, see you at the Deuce. (yelling out to Lady Bird) ’m not paying you to flirt! (embarrassed) wasn’t flirting. wish you had been. And then he’s gone. Lady Bird’s loins are on fire. . ’ . . She writes Kyle’s name next to where she’d written Danny’s name. Touches her hand where he’d touched it. Then touches her mouth. She wants, she wants. 50. . . . Joint liturgy at another beginning of the semester. Lady Bird sits next to Julie and sings in the choir and scans for Kyle. From under her choir robe, Lady Bird pulls out “The People’s History of the United States” and reads it while the priest delivers the homily. Danny tries to make eye contact with Lady Bird but she coldly looks away. Her eyes rest on Jenna - she wants Kyle as her boyfriend and Jenna as her friend. She wants to be part of this thing, this popular-straight-kid thing she’s always been outside of. Lady Bird takes her blessing, arms crossed. . . . The first time we did it was at his lake house last summer. It was so funny... Julie hands Lady Bird a sack lunch: From Uncle Matt. think he and my Mom are fighting, so enjoy these lunches while you can. Oh, no thanks, ’m trying to lose weight. Really? But Lady Bird isn’t paying attention. She’s angling towards Jenna Walton, the tan, who holds court: Yeah, sex is not a big deal, it’s just my mom called during it! Everyone laughs. 51. (’) It was on my cell phone, she got it for emergencies. Did you pick up? Yeah, was like, ""um, Mom, can't really talk right now."" Everyone else laughs again. Julie now tries to join in: (to Jenna) What was the emergency? What? Oh, my great aunt died. What was the emergency? Oh, my great aunt died. 'm so sorry. She kind of did it to herself. Yeah. don’t know why do that if you’re already so old. Sister Sarah-Joan approaches: - Ladies - skirts? Jenna's skirt doesn’t make the grade, it’s been hemmed. - (’) ’m going to write you a citation, Miss Walton. 52. - No more short skirts! She continues on, inspecting other skirts. Sarah-Joan is all up in my jock. She’s a cunt. Birdy you like her. Yeah, but, she’s a cunt. (to Jenna) have an idea of how to get Sarah- Joan back... How? You’ll see. This afternoon? No, we have auditions this afternoon. don’t think want to do the play. (to Jenna) Meet me in the teacher’s parking lot at 3. ’ll have the materials. Wait what was your name? Lady Bird. Weird. - We have a decision to make: prom themes! The top options are -- Cities of the World, Eternal Flame, and Movies! . - /. . Everyone who has come to audition is greeted by the new director: Father Walther, also the football coach. #1 53. Where’s Father Leviatch? Alright let’s have everyone take a knee. Confusion. Miss Patty won’t make eye contact with them Cozy sit. So know that you all miss Father Leviatch, all of the brothers do too, but am going to give this my very best shot, okay? Usually ’m the .. football coach, but from what can tell a “play” is a “play.” No real response. Danny sits with Julie, whispers: Where’s Lady Bird? (quietly angry) With her new best friend. She thinks she’s too cool for theatre. Father Walther wheels out a blackboard and picks up chalk. Now if you can pull out your scripts. ’ve assigned a number to each of your roles. ’m going to put the blocking on this board, and if you guys can transcribe into your plays, that’d be great. (calling out) Who is playing what part? had Miss Patty assign parts because she already knows you all. Miss Patty nods. (’) Call ‘em out Miss Patty! Miss Patty starts: 54. (slightly drunk on power) Uh, Prospero, Danny. Julie is Miranda - she’s happy, maybe she’s good at this? . . . Jenna and Lady Bird are decorating the nun mini-van with tin cans and streamers and attach a sign to the back that reads: . As they’re completing their mission: Wait, where do you live? Oh, um, the 40s. That’s where our starter house was! Which street? (lying, again) Um, 44th it’s, um, it’s the three story blue house with the white shutters and the American flag in the front. She describes the house that she and Julie lusted after last fall, Danny’s Grandmother’s house. know that one! Wanna go over there now and eat? live in Granite Bay otherwise ’d say lets go there. Um, actually, was thinking - maybe we should go to the Deuce? (trying to be casual) was talking to Kyle about it and he was like “whatever it’s lame but maybe ’ll see you there.” How do you know Kyle? 55. My Mom made me get a job at New Helvetia to learn “responsibility” Anyway we hang out there. Yeah, Kyle’s awesome. let’s Deuce it up. . - /. . Father Walther is writing all the blocking on the blackboard like the football coach he is. All the students are frantically taking down the notes in their scripts. . . “ .” . . Jenna joins Jonah & co in the parking lot, drinking and smoking. Kyle is there, sitting on top of a car reading another big book, a theoretical math book. For fun. This is the Deuce? It’s a parking lot? We were in one parking lot and we went to another parking lot. (calling out) ! Lady Bird and just decorated the nun-mobile like “just married to Jesus! That’s hella tight. He nods, appreciating this. Jonah starts to make out with Jenna. Lady Bird tries not to watch. (’) What you did was very baller, very anarchist. Yeah, fuck ‘em. Don’t worry, ’m not gonna snitch on you. (fake threatening) hope not, because ’d fucking kill your family. 56. What? Sorry that was an exaggeration. It’s okay. My Dad has cancer. So guess God is doing that for us. Oh... ’m sorry. They’re quiet for a second, he’s said something heavy. You work at New Helvetia, right? Right. Can get your number? We were looking to set up some more gigs down there... Definitely. He holds out his hand and a pen. Lady Bird takes his hand and the pen. When she touches him, it’s the same as before: . (’) It’s my parents’ number. You don’t have a cell phone? Nah. Good girl. The government didn’t have to put tracking devices on us, we bought them and put them on ourselves. don’t own a tracking device... No the cell phones. See? 57. Wow. Yeah. know. mean you’ll have one eventually. Everyone’s gonna have one. And then it’ll be a matter of time. Before what? Before they put them in our brains. Lady Bird laughs and then stops herself. He is dead fucking serious. She wants to touch him again but can’t invent a reason why. . . . Lady Bird works. Zones out from time to time, thinking about Kyle. Danny comes in and then lurks. She spots him, goes to throw out the trash, annoyed that he’s there. . . . Lady Bird walks out, Danny follows her. She wheels around: What do you want from me? He doesn’t say anything. (’) ?! My Grandma wanted me to tell you she missed you at Christmas. Yeah, well, couldn’t have gone anyway... my Mom was pissed about Thanksgiving. (nodding) Your mom is crazy. ’m scared of her. 58. (suddenly defensive) She’s not crazy, she’s just, she has a big heart. She’s very warm. don’t find your mother warm. You don’t? Well no yeah she’s warm but she’s also kind of scary. You can’t be scary and warm. (logically debating) think you can, your Mom is. ’ ’ ! That shuts him up. They’re quiet. (suddenly, desperate) Fuck me. Can you not tell anyone, please? ’m so sorry about everything. ’m so ashamed of all of it. It’s going to be bad and just need a little bit of time to figure out how ’m going to tell my mom and dad. He almost starts crying. (pats him awkwardly) Don’t worry, won’t tell. (leaning into her,sobbing) Thank you. 59. He’s telling the truth and she is genuinely touched. They embrace again. They are friends, real friends now. . . -. . Marion helps a patient fill out a questionnaire. It is Father Leviatch, who looks how he feels - crushed by bottomless despair. This is his struggle. ...and do you have a support system? What do you mean? (gently) Who do you turn to when you feel this way? No one, guess. ’m sorry. No, no, don’t be sorry. There’s no wrong answer. She looks at him with true empathy. He realizes something. Please don’t tell your daughter. No of course not. Of course not. 60. . . . All of Xavier and Immaculate Heart of Mary are assembled for Ash Wednesday Mass. Everyone gets ash on their forehead. Julie looks on enviously as Lady Bird jokes around with Jenna and flirts with Kyle from across the aisle. The priest repeats the incantation every time he applies ashes to the foreheads. Remember that you are dust and to dust you shall return... Remember that you are dust and to dust you shall return.... . //’ . . Lady Bird sits at the computer with a list of instructions in front of her - Marion, Larry, Shelly and Miguel stand behind her. It’s a new system - you just enter your social security number and... She is presses and is lead you to a website that lists all the schools in the system she applied to with a “yes” or a “no” beside them. They all say no except for... (’) ?! (relieved) Davis is good. Maybe you should have looked at it. It’s only half an hour away! Less if you’re driving fast! went to graduate school there. Lots of smart people go to Davis. thought Berkeley had to accept me. You and Miguel went there. ’m a legacy. 61. Eh, not if we don’t give money. And you get bad grades. Oh what do you know about it? Meaning? Nothing. (turning red) What are you implying? . didn’t say anything. ’ ! ’m sure they had no idea, ! You are actually fucking evil. What is wrong with you? - ! ’m not ! did not raise you like this, didn’t -- don’t have to go ! ’m not going to a fucking university that’s famous for it’s fucking . She runs out, furious. She’d kick the computer if she could. (..) (’) ’ 62. ! Miguel self-consciously puts his hand to his nose-ring, rotating it. Shelly mentally tallies all her piercings. 63. . ' . . fancy McMansion, giant but not utterly tasteless. low-key house party. Lady Bird wanders through the palatial house, looking for Jenna. Runs up to her: Hey! (hugging her) Hi! Help yourself to anything in the fridge. My parent’s are upstairs but they don’t care if you drink. She nods and moves on. What she’s looking for is Kyle of course. She spots Kyle outside, reading a book and smoking. . ' . . . Lady Bird casually slinks outside and lights up a clove, like she does it all the time. Kyle notices like he was meant to. hate that shit. But you smoke. Hand rolled cigarettes - never industrially produced and never cloves. What’s wrong with cloves? You can’t inhale cloves. What’s the point? Oh... You’re not supposed to. Cloves were what first smoked, when was young, so you know, force of habit. Huh. Well it has fiber glass. 64. Really? Rolling your own is best. Also ’m trying to, as much as is possible, not participate in our economy. don’t like money. am trying to live by bartering alone. But doesn’t Catholic school cost money? Yeah the diocese were not super into it. (then) It mattered to my Dad that go to Xavier, so just trying to make him happy. She sits down next to him. He touches her face. She breathes out hard. He kisses her and she kisses back. : Another part of the house: Kyle and Lady Bird are making out full on. She wants it, but not so fast: don’t want to have sex yet. haven’t had sex yet. With another person. No, me neither. Really? Yeah. Cool. They start making out again. They fall into a door and it reveals . Lady Bird laughs. (’) Oh my god! It’s the tanning bed! Julie will love this! 65. Who’s Julie? . . . Lady Bird sits on the edge of the tub and looks at a picture of Kyle from the “Xavier” insert in the Immaculate Heart of Mary Yearbook. : Just Lady Bird’s feet on either side of the tub-tile, the water streaming down. It’s obvious what she’s doing. : She’s out. She has towels wrapped around her body and head. She rummages around the medicine cabinet. She sees a pill bottle and looks at it. It’s antidepressants for her Dad. She puts it back, carefully. (..) Lady Bird! You can’t lock yourself in there! We have one bathroom! (opening the door) Sorry, sorry, sorry! (’) It’s just this is the only place can get any privacy. Marion clocks the towels around Lady Bird’s head and body: Do you really need to use two towels? No, guess no. If you need two towels you just have to say so because this affects my whole day, have to do laundry before work and need to know if there are more towels need to wash. just need one, sorry. 66. , well let me get to the mirror, gotta get going. Lady Bird backs up, watches Marion put on makeup. When do you think is a normal time to have sex? (drops her mascara) You’re having sex? No! Uh, college is good, think college. Use protection. Like we talked about. Ok. They regard each other. (’) Is Dad depressed? (looking from the mirror) Why do you ask that? The pills... they have Dad’s name on them. Marion’s not sure she should talk about it, but then does: Dad’s been struggling with depression for years. didn’t know that. 67. Money is not life’s report card. He’s depressed about money? Being successful doesn’t mean anything in and of itself. It just means that you’re successful. (confused) Yeah, but then you’re successful. But that doesn’t mean you’re happy. But he’s not happy. . ’ . . . Lady Bird and Jenna messing around in her big pool, splashing each other, being teenage ladies-of-leisure. Lady Bird is feeling the weight of her life, the heft of it. have to get out of Sacramento. Why? Because it’s soul-killing. It’s the mid-west of California. Isn’t there a thing, like: “think globally, act locally.” feel that the person who said that didn’t live in Sacramento. love it here. want to send my daughters to Immaculate Heart. want to be, you know, be a mom. 68. At least go to San Francisco. don't like hills. Jenna disappears under the water. Lady Bird considers that perhaps Jenna is not such a good fit for her as a friend, even if she is popular and cool. They aren’t the same. . . . Julie’s desk is empty beside Lady Bird. She misses her real friend. . . . . Lady Bird sees Julie walking in the hallway with Darlene, the weird girl from choir. She calls out: Julie! Julie! Julie, hey! (aggressive) What do you want from Julie? Darlene can you excuse us? Darlene, stay. So Darlene stays, her creepy cow eyes taking in the scene. Why aren’t you in Algebra ? switched sections. Why? 69. Aren’t Jenna and Kyle enough? ’m sorry that you’re jealous. ! Jenna is a moron, you know. She’s not. She’s in Calculus. She’s a moron in a deeper sense. You don’t even know her. -- Miss Patty assigned you a role, by the way. You just never showed up to claim it. What role? “The Tempest.” There is no role of “The Tempest.” It’s the titular role! No, it’s a made up thing so we all can participate. Can’t do anything unless you’re the center of attention, can you? Yeah, well, you know your mom's tits? They're . . She made a bad decision at 19! Two bad decisions. 70. Julie leaves with Darlene. Lady Bird is furious and righteous. . . . Everyone sits on the bleachers for a “special assembly.” Jenna and Lady Bird sit together. Lady Bird loves being seen with her at this public event. woman is speaking - she is heavy-set with a “wedge” haircut. She holds up models of fetuses. 70. And at fifteen, this girl was pregnant. She decided that she was going to get an abortion. It made sense. It was the right thing to do. (whispering) Let me guess she didn’t get it. And she was sitting there waiting for the doctor to come in and something deep inside her said . Bingo. Anyone want to guess who this woman is? Hands shoot up. (’) The young lady right here. You? 71. No, it was not me. Um, your friend? No, the girl in the story was... my mother. Gasps from the audience. (’) am that baby that she decided not to abort. Cut to: Laminated graphics about abortion are being passed around. (’) That could have been me, that could have been my fate. (to Jenna) Just because something looks ugly doesn’t mean that it is morally wrong. Unfortunately this comment was loud enough for Casey to hear. What did you say, ma’am? Nothing. Please share. Lady Bird looks at Jenna and decides that she’s really going to impress her: (loud) said “Just because something looks ugly doesn’t mean that it is morally wrong.” The girls are shocked and embarrassed, but laughing too. 72. You think dead children aren’t morally wrong? No... She’s going all in: (’) ’m just saying that if you took up close pictures of my vagina while was on my period it would be disturbing but it doesn’t make it wrong. ! Sister Sarah-Joan clocks Lady Bird’s escalating mania. She briefly makes eye-contact with her. Lady-Bird is ashamed, but uses her shame to plow ahead rather than turn back. (horrified) Excuse me? What did you say? Listen, if your mother had had the abortion we wouldn't have to sit through this stupid assembly? (..) Suspended?! ?! . //’ . . Marion is furious. Larry pretends to work on the computer. we do is for you. . You think like driving that car around. Do you? You think like working double shifts at the psych hospital? You needed to go to the Catholic school because your brother saw someone knifed in front of him at the public school, is that what you want? (turns on Larry) - No. No. No. No.... , ?! Nothing. 73. (back to Lady Bird) You think Dad and don’t know how ashamed that you are of us? Your dad knows, your dad knows why you ask us to drop you a block away from school every day - - Dad didn’t mean to - - You made him feel horrible do you know that? (crying) ’m sorry. Larry chimes in. 74. Marion you didn’t have to bring that up - - No, Larry, you can’t just be the nice guy, she has to know, she has to know how you feel otherwise she’s just gonna think that she can say anything at all and nobody ever gets hurt.”Wrong side of the tracks”. didn’t mean it that way, it was a joke -- Yeah, it’s just a joke: “Mom and Dad, they don’t care.” We didn’t think we’d be in this house for twenty-five years, we thought we’d move somewhere better, Whatever we give you, it’s never enough. It is enough. Do you have any idea how much it cost to raise you? How much you’re away every day? Lady Bird, tired of being berated, furiously gets a pen and a piece of paper, poised to write, cuts Marion off: Give me a number. What? ! don’t understand. You give me a number for how much it cost to raise me, and ’m going to get older and make a lot of money and write you a check for what owe you so that . 75. highly doubt that you will be able to get a job good enough to do that. Lady Bird screams and raises her hand at her mother. Brings it down without striking. Leaves the room without a sound. . ’ . . Lady Bird lounging - watching television. Life during Suspension. All these reports about the lead up to the Iraq war. It’s simultaneously terrifying and boring. The phone rings and she at it. (into the phone) Hello? (..) Hi, it’s me! Jenna. (looking at the time) Are you calling me from school? (..) No, we got out early because all the Irish girls got totally sloshed by noon... Oh, right, happy Saint Patrick’s Day! (..) guess they’d been stock-piling mini liquor bottles in the tampon machines. Now they’re all throwing up. Everyone else got out early. So where am?! don’t know, where? Reveal that Jenna is: . . . It is the house. Danny’s Grandmother’s house. The blue one with the white shutters and the American Flag. The one Lady Bird said she lived in. Jenna is standing there in her uniform. 76. ’ ! She rings the doorbell. (..) Oh, shit, no, ’m... wait. (..) ! , ! . ’ . . : Lady Bird and Jenna in her kitchen. Her real kitchen. (looking around) So this is your house? Yeah. The woman who lived in the other house was totally freaked out. That’s my friend’s grandma. That’s her house. Why did you say it was your house? Reaching for the truth that explains it: wished lived in that house. don’t even sort of understand why somebody would lie about that. 77. didn’t lie. You lied, you’re a liar. hate dishonesty. ’m sorry. Apology accepted, guess. (concerned) Are we still friends? mean, if you’re still Kyle’s girlfriend, then yeah, guess ’ll see you around. Lady Bird looks worried - is she still Kyle’s girlfriend? . ’ . ’ . . They watch the news, not touching but oh man she wants to touch. : Kyle and Lady Bird are making out pretty heavily. Lady Bird is on top. She whispers: ’m ready. (regular voice) What? (a bit louder) ’m ready... to have sex... Okay, great. 78. He reaches over, fetches a condom. Gets it on somehow. You’re so dextrous with that... Oh! They’re sort of having sex now. She’s still on top. It goes on for a little bit. Then he stops moving. (’) (whispering) Are you...? Done? Yeah. Yes. Sorry, was confused. She looks at him. His face is all splotchy. You have some kind of - blood! (hands to her face) Oh, shit, get nose bleeds. ’m sorry. : Kyle reads. Lady Bird holds a Kleenex to her nose, and looks at a bulletin board with the class picture from first grade - little Kyle wears a tie-dye shirt. (’) Remember when “tie-dye” was an activity? 79. (glancing up) didn’t make that shirt, my parents bought it for me at Sea Ranch, you can read “Sea Ranch” if you look close. (making a joke) Cut to “ten years later.” What? Like how ten years ago you were in first grade and now we... Cut to! (quizzical) What does “cut to” mean to you? Or like ""little did he know..."" Nothing you're saying makes sense. How we’re not virgins now! We deflowered each other. We have each other’s flowers. She kisses him and tries to hold him but then backs off. (’) Sorry, ’m just happy. didn’t lose my virginity to you. Wait - what? lost my virginity to Cassie Duval. Excuse me? 80. You said you were a virgin. No didn’t. Because ’m not. And haven’t lied in two years. Oh Jesus. Yeah, ’ve probably slept with, six people? You don’t even know if it’s six people? don’t keep a list. Why wouldn’t you keep a list we’re in high school? Why are you getting so moody? You did say you were a virgin. think you might have made an assumption. just had a whole experience that was wrong. She sits. Kyle opens his book up again and then closes it: You're deciding to be upset. No, am upset. Because you’re deciding to be. Don't be mad at me for this. That's stupid. You can't be mad at me for something have no control over now. just wanted it to be special. 81. Why? You’re going to have so much un-special sex in your life. (fully angry now) was on top! Who the fuck is on top their first time! Do you have any awareness about how many civilians we’ve killed since invasion in Iraq started? . . Different things can be sad. It’s not all war. Kyle moves away and opens a book. (worried) Are we still going to prom together? Sure. Kyle has been reading something out of the corner of his eye. . . ’ . . Lady Bird sneaks down the stairs, still crying, trying to get away without a conversation. Through a door, she sees Kyle’s Dad. He’s very thin and wears lots of sweaters, obviously sick. He drinks a cup of tea. . ’ . . Lady Bird waits outside, sitting on the curb. The Toyota Corolla pulls up. It’s Marion. Lady Bird does a double-take. ./. 1994 . . As Lady Bird climbs in the car: thought Miguel was going to pick me up. 82. Well, was just arriving from work and... She wants to say she misses Lady Bird but instead says: (’) It was easier. Lady Bird starts crying. Very hard. Marion pulls over, hugs her: (’) Hey, it’s okay, it’s okay. As she’s rubbing her back, Marion takes in Lady Bird’s shirt, she doesn’t recognize it. (’) What is this sweater? Oh, it’s just, my friend Jenna gave it to me. Who’s Jenna? My friend. Marion doesn’t know her daughter’s friends, her t-shirts, or why she’s crying. She holds Lady Bird, then thinks of something: ... want to do our favorite Sunday activity? don’t have a second shift... Lady Bird nods, it would be nice. ./. . . Marion and Lady Bird go to all the different open houses. They love doing this. They could never buy any of them, but it is so neat to see the inside of houses you’ve always known, and to imagine a different life. Where would your bed go?, etc. It’s a great day. Maybe the best in a long time. Maybe ever. 83. . ’ . . Lady Bird is back to watching television. The invasion is full on, it’s the Shock and Awe portion of the Iraq war. Lady Bird! bunch of things arrived for you! Lady Bird rushes in, snatches the envelopes from his hand: (turning hot) Holy shit! Since when do you get mail? get mail. Whatever you’re up to, it’s not going to end well. . ’ . . She opens a bunch of letters - they are all rejections. for one letter, the letter that says “Wait-listed.” She screams silently to herself.

Larry leaves his awkward interview to come get Lady Bird. She’s reading a stack of old magazines. How’d it go? 85. (exhausted) Let’s go buy a big bag of Doritos and eat them in the car to celebrate your waitlist. (laughing) Don’t tell Mom! About the Doritos or the waitlist! Then Miguel enters the waiting room. Larry and Lady Bird do a double take. Miguel looks much more conventional. Handsome, too. All his piercings are out, his tattoos covered. Oh... hi, son! Wait, what are you doing here? guess we’re um, going for the same job then? It looks like it. Go get ‘em! Larry and Miguel hug. Miguel goes in to the interview. Larry watches him go, feeling how you’d be feeling at that moment. Lady Bird aches for her Dad. . -' . . Lady Bird hands in homework from being suspended. Sarah-Joan looks it over, then: - know it was you who did the “Just Married” thing. It wasn’t me. - ’m not going to punish you. 86. Oh... why not? - (laughing) It was funny. Sister Gina and drove all the way home before we noticed people were honking. Really? - To be fair, wasn’t just married to Jesus. It’s been forty years...

Lady Bird is in the dressing room trying things on. (sadly) guess you won’t be going to dances in college. This is our last one. (then) You know, Davis has a terrific theatre. If you’re still interested in theatre. Are you? Lady Bird comes out in a dress, it’s too tight: ’m probably no good at acting. (looking at herself) Why don’t look like the girls in the magazines? It’s too bad can’t meet this Kyle before prom. He’s not my boyfriend anymore. mean, maybe he never even was. ’d still like to meet him. (..) (re: the dress) ’ ! .

You’re giving me an eating disorder! (’) (to herself) wish could get an eating disorder. Lady Bird comes out again. The dress kind of fits her. It’s bright pink and frilly. She looks happy: (’) love it. Smiles up at her Mom, looking for approval: (considering) Is it too pink? Lady Bird silently goes back into the dressing room. Her Mom just crushed something that she liked and was very “her.” Marion picks up that she’s upset: (’) What? (..) Why can’t you say look nice? thought you didn’t even care what think. (..) still want you to think look good. ’m sorry, was telling you the truth. Do you want me to lie? (..) No, just wish... wish that you liked me. 89. Of course love you. Lady Bird comes out. Looks at Marion with the pure question: But do you like me? (faltering) ... want you to be the very best version of yourself you can be. What if this is the best version? . ’ . . Lady Bird all dressed up in her pink dress. The one Marion didn’t like. Miguel, Shelly and Larry wait with her. She keeps checking the window. You look really pretty. Really? Shelly nods. You look like a bad ass girl in a band. This makes Lady Bird feel pretty amazing. Then a car horn honks. It’s Kyle. He literally honks. Um, guess, that’s my date. You aren’t going to get in the car with a guy who honks, are you? think, yes, am. Larry shrugs, accepting the situation. Let me get your picture. Mom’s pissed she had to work a double. 90. (peering out the window) Even you deserve better than this. Larry snaps a picture of Lady Bird, standing alone. Have a good time! Yeah, good luck! Larry snaps a picture of Lady Bird, standing alone. . ’ . . Lady Bird approaches and catches Jenna and Jonah talking in the back seat: think she’s weird. She is weird. (announcing herself) Hey guys. guess ’ll just, sit shotgun? You look really nice, Kyle. You look good. He moves some books, probably math books, and she sits. Jenna doesn’t make eye contact with her. . ’ . . Driving around with Jonah and Jenna. It’s no fun. (on the phone) Hey, what’s going on, man. Yeah, , that sounds great. . (hangs up the phone) Do you guys want to ditch prom and just go to Mike’s instead? Yeah, hate dances. ! Yeah, okay. No prom. 91. “Crash Into Me” comes on the radio. fucking hate this song. 92. He switches it. Suddenly Lady Bird sits up very straight. love it. actually want to go to prom. Um, okay? mean don’t really wanna do that. Can you take me to my friend Julie’s house, please? Sure. Who’s Julie? She’s my best friend. . ’ . . Kyle drops off Lady Bird. Screeches away. Lady Bird stands in front of Julie’s apartment complex. She’s milling around when a car pulls up: it’s Julie’s Mom, Ms. Pickett - coming in from grocery shopping. . ’ . . Julie’s Mom knocks on the door. . Julie, honey, there’s someone here to see you. She steps in. Julie looks up, she’s been crying. Hi... (’) Hey, are you okay? Oh, yeah, ’m fine, ’m fine. What happened? 93. Nothing. Really, nothing. Why are you crying? 94. ’m just crying - some people aren’t built happy, you know? . ’ . . : : They laugh really hard. They catch their breath and notice that they are on the last slice of the block of cheese. We ate all the cheese! (’) It’s ok, Blocks of cheese vary in size, that was a small one. So small. (’) Fuck it, let’s go to prom. Doesn’t your Mom have a dress? Let’s be honest, ’ve had a dress for months. It’s purple and you’re really gonna like it. 95. . . . Julie and Lady Bird are slow dancing together. All the decorations, the whole thing, looks like hell, actual hell. There are flames everywhere. They are taking pictures together and happy - it is their last hurrah. : . . . In their prom dresses. They watch the sun come up over Capital Bridge on the Sacramento River. Their small-town version of the sunrise scene over the Brooklyn Bridge in “Manhattan.” People make so much noise in the movies, but it’s really not a big thing, you can totally be quiet during it. Was it amazing, though? (thinks) wanted it so badly but then found that when it happened, really like dry humping much more. You’re a virgin. (excited) can’t wait for State Fair. know! 96. ! - !

Lady Bird sits in the audience and watches The Tempest. Close on Danny performing Prospero’s last speech. It’s beautiful: ... now want Spirits to enforce, art to enchant, And my ending is despair, Unless be relieved by prayer, which pierces so that it assaults mercy itself and frees all faults. As you from crimes would pardoned be, let your indulgence set me free. The play is over - Father Walther, ever the football coach, jumps up and cheers. Lady Bird has tears in her eyes. She loves watching her friend’s be great. . . . Everyone is graduating. . . . Cut toLady Bird celebrating with her family, hugging them. To Miguel and his new job! 98. To Lady Bird going to Davis!

You walked weird across the stage, but you did it. didn’t walk weird! It seemed a little weird, the way you walked. ! 99. Marion smiles at Lady Bird. Lady Bird smiles back. Danny walks over to their table.He embraces her in a big hug. They’re friends, real friends. Hi, everyone! miss you guys! They all chorus that they miss him, too. Proudly: (’) Did you find out about the wait list? Marion looks at Lady Bird and then back to Danny. Oh, fuck. What? Marion’s eyes darken. ./. ’ . . Lady Bird is still in her graduation gown. Marion is doing dishes, laundry, not looking at her, not speaking to her. Lady Bird trails after her: ’m not even in yet, so this might not even be a problem... Mom? Follows Marion into the kitchen. She sees her Dad sitting in the living room, looking scolded: he’s just gotten an earful. Lady Bird keeps pursuing her Mom. 100 . (’) ’m sorry, shouldn’t have gone behind your back, it’s not like am definitely going to New York. Nothing from Marion. (’) Mom. Mom. Aren’t you sort of proud that ’m so close to getting in? Just a little? Follows Marion to the backyard, where she begins weeding. (’) mean, yes, know it was probably easier because 9/11 and less people applying with terrorism and all that, still though ... ’m sorry, know can lie and not be a good person but... Follows Marion to the trash can, almost crying. (’) Please, Mom, please ’m so sorry, didn’t mean to hurt you - appreciate everything you’ve done for me, ’m ungrateful and ’m so sorry, ’m so sorry wanted more... Nothing from her. Marion goes back into the kitchen, screen door slamming behind her.Shouting now, panicked trying to get her attention. (’) ! ! ! ! . know, know, know ’m so bad, just please! . Nothing from her mother. () . . . Lady Bird is learning the ropes of the grocery store. She’s trying to scan items. Hangs out with Shelly. 101 . . . .

You’re my only daughter. Well, Shelly too, kind of. Make a wish. Lady Bird blows out the candle. Then: Are you and Mom going to get a divorce over this? No... we can’t afford to! ’m kidding, no. love your Mom. (looking down) Does Mom hate me? You both have such... strong personalities. She doesn’t know how to help you and that frustrates her. wish she’d talk to me. She will, know. Happy 18. Thanks. Do you want some? Yes. . . . Lady Bird walks confidently up to the counter. One pack of Camel Lights, please. And a scratcher. And a Playgirl. 103 . . Lady Bird hands over her . (’) (barely looking at it) That’ll be ten eighty seven. Oh, it’s my birthday today. ’m eighteen. Which is why all these things. can buy them. Okay, happy birthday. . . . She smokes a cigarette. Legally. It’s gross. . ’ . . Early morning. Lady Bird is sitting outside on the porch, writing. Trying to be like a lady poet. The mailman comes up and gives Lady Bird the mail. She opens the paper to the obituaries, just like her Mom - sees that Kyle’s Dad has died. Richard Scheible (1953-2003). She goes to the lawn and sits down on the grass and thinks. Flips through the other mail. At the bottom is a fat letter from the college. She opens it. She got in. . . . Larry and Lady Bird sit in front of a banker. So with her scholarships and then if we re-finance the house... then where are we? . . . Marion struggling to write something. She works on a yellow legal pad. Keeps throwing away versions. . . . Larry gives Lady Bird a cell phone. You’re only supposed to use it for emergencies. (laughs) It’s my tracking device. . ’ . . Lady Bird repaints her room, covering the pink walls – and Danny and Kyle’s names – in fresh white. . 1994 . . Lady Bird sits in the backseat while Marion drives and Larry sits shotgun. Sacramento goes by. ./. 1994 . . , 2003. Lady Bird and Larry get out. Larry secretly slips a manila envelope into the front of the suitcase. Lady Bird leans back into the car and talks to Marion: Thank you for driving. You’re welcome. You aren't coming? You can't walk up to the gate anymore, anyway. Yeah, but, 'm going to college. Marion can barely look at her, it’s too hard and she’s too mad and hurts too much. Dad will walk you to security, parking is too expensive here. Marion drives away abruptly. Lady Bird gets smaller in the frame. Marion is the focus. Marion circles, then circles back. She is crying now, she thought it would be easier to not say goodbye but it isn’t. She parks the car. Runs as fast as she can to go say goodbye. Runs into the airport looking for Lady Bird and Larry. Sees Larry walking towards her. (hugging her while she cries) It’s ok, she’ll be back, she’ll come back. . . . Lady Bird unpacks, putting things in their places. She reaches in the front pocket of her suitcase and pulls out: manila envelope. She opens it, and all these letters fall out - crumpled up starts and half-starts. She looks at all of them one at a time. They all begin essentially the same: “ love you so much and don’t know how to tell you that, can’t communicate it to you in a way that ...” : Lady Bird is on the phone with Larry: (..) She was worried that there would be errors, or mistakes or something... () (..) (') that you’d judge her writing abilities. wouldn’t do that. (..) thought you should have them. (..) want you to know how much she loves you but also don’t tell her salvaged them, okay? Ok... She touches all these letters her mother couldn’t send. And she can never tell her that she has them. . . Lady Bird sits in a dorm room full of college freshman. She stares at a half drunk paper cup of rum in her hand. She looks up, questioning: Hey. Do you believe in God? No. Why not? Because it’s ridiculous. (shaking her head) People will call each other by names their parents made up for them but they won’t believe in God. What’s your name? (considering) Christine. My name is Christine. ’m David. They shake hands. You shake. shake. Where are you from? Sacramento. Sorry, where? The music was too loud, he hadn’t heard her. Second try: San Francisco. Cool! San Francisco is a great city. She is immediately ashamed, but pleased with her social success. She drinks everything. : Lady Bird is very drunk now. She leans out the window. David does, too. She yells at the sky. ! No, my name is David. . ’ . . Back in her dorm with the David. She is so drunk that she is half way between passing out and throwing up. David is flipping through her giant case. Jesus Christ you have bad music. It’s all Greatest Hits. But they’re the Greatest, what’s wrong with that? David puts down the case and starts making out with her. She throws up all over him. Oh, god, oh god! He gets up and runs away, out of the room. . . . Christine being loaded onto some kind of strap down chair. She is crying. ’m sorry. . . . Christine looks up, half awake. nurse comes into focus. What do you want us to do, she’s drunk. Christine passes out again. . . . Christine opens her eyes. Looks at her bracelet.

Snippets of a sermon, some donation baskets. The choir gets up to sing “Blessed Assurance.” Christine listens and then cries, hard, and then starts laughing and singing along. It turns out that her life is just beginning. She ducks into the entry-way of the church. Gets out her phone, calls her home phone. It rings and rings. She leaves a message: Hi Mom and Dad, it’s me. Christine. It’s the name you gave me. It’s a good one. Dad, this is more for Mom - Hey Mom: did you feel emotional the first time that you drove in Sacramento? did and wanted to tell you, but we weren’t really talking when it happened. All those bends ’ve known my whole life, and stores, and the whole thing. But wanted to tell you. love you. Thank you, ’m... thank you.

Sophie nods. 8 Sophie works out to a video in the tiny living room. 8 Frances half watches. 9 Frances and Sophie smoke in two separate adjacent 9 windows. They both lean outside. We see them talking outside the windows. 10 They sit across from each other in their living room. 10 (..)

She is wearing dance clothes underneath a knit dress, and her hair is pulled back. bulky canvas backpack sits beside her. She’ll have it the whole film. on her fingers smoothing the skin on her arm. (excited) There’s this house in Westchester, the basement is all Cornish Rexes, it smells awful, the top floor is Siamese cats. She nods and hands Dan, early 30’s, back the photo. He sits opposite her on a thrift-store couch, a manilla envelope in his lap. ’m allergic to cats. They’re hypo-allergenic. (quick smile) This is a special Frances kitty. Oh...who knew? He passes her back a photo. This one is the runt. Which is cheaper but think is the best one anyway. figured one runt and one regular? 4. Frances hesitates. put a hundred dollar down payment on each cat...or eighty for the runt and a hundred for the other one. Pause. Why not get one cat? cat needs a buddy. If you get one cat you need to get two cats. ’ll give you two hundred dollars to get no cats. He nods, somewhat hurt and annoyed, glances back at the photo of the runt, starts stacking the photos and tucking them back into the envelope. Frances comes over and sits next to him, puts her hand on his back. So, who will take care of them if you go away? thought...we’d get them together. And move them back and forth between our apartments? No... thought maybe you could move in with me... Frances hesitates. (strangely) Oh, wow... Do you want to move in with me? 5. Yeah. Yeah? Yes.

It’ll drain the blood out. Frances does. look like ’m asking a question. ’m not doing anything wrong. Our lease was going to be up in two months anyway. They ride in silence, Frances’ hand over her head. 30 . ’ . . 30 Frances gets a tea bag out and puts it in a mug. She rattles around the cabinets looking for a kettle. Not finding a kettle, she boils water in a saucepan. While she’s waiting for the water to boil, she lights a cigarette. The apartment is nearly empty. It turns out Sophie had most of the furniture and Frances had most of the books. It looks like the crack den of a pretty well educated junkie. The water boils. Frances tries to pour it into the mug, but scalds herself. She kicks the kitchen cabinet. Frances is on the phone. She moves. (on the phone) We bought the kettle ! ? At the Mexican superstore? Jesus! . . 21. 31 . . 31 Mailbox. Frances is checking the mail. Sees something she likes. Tax rebate! Whoops and runs out onto the street. 32 . . . 32 Frances leaves the bank. Is still elated. Looks around, unsure what to do next. Her elation leaves her slightly. She pulls out her phone and scrolls. Half shrugs, calls someone. Hey just got a tax rebate, want to go out to dinner?! 33 . . 33 Lev (from the party) is scrolling through his phone. He finds the photo he was looking for and hands the phone to Frances across the table. This is me in the locker room of the Knicks. Wow! Sophie said you liked basketball. That was just one time. Frances changes the picture. Wow! Crazy! (looking at the picture) Oh, yeah, was goofing around on this Vintage Triumph think ’m going to buy. Motorcycles are so loud. What? 22. mean, you can’t listen to music while you’re on a motorcycle. But you’re on a motorcycle. Lev takes back his phone, finds a new picture. Check it. This is me with Jay Leno. He’s such a dick. know, but don’t you just love him? The waitress comes up to give them the check. Frances grabs it and puts her credit card in. No! Yes! ! No... mean, ! ’m the one with the tax rebate! Can take this? Yes! Oh...fine. The waitress leaves. Just because you bought dinner doesn’t mean ’m going to sleep with you. (not getting it) ’m not trying to sleep with you... 23. No, ’m pretending to be a liberated woman. Oh, got it. Thanks for paying. That was very sweet. You’re a lady. He takes her hand. She lets him. The waitress comes back. Frances immediately withdraws her hand. ’m sorry, but the card didn’t go through, do you have another card you want to try? Oh, shit! Sorry, yes, um, this is a debit card? Only credit cards or cash. Okay. (to Lev) ’m so embarrassed, ’m not a real person yet. got it. (getting up from the table) No, no, no, ’m just going to go run and get some cash. 34 . . 34 Frances hustles down the street, looking for an . 35 . . 35 Frances runs in. Where is your ? Not working. No . 24. 36 . . 36 She looks for a bank or something. She stops a woman. Do you know where a bank is? Um, there’s a Bank of America about five blocks up. 37 . . 37 Frances punches in her pin in the area of a closed of while a homeless man looks on. “Do you accept the $3.00 service charge?” She sighs, her finger hovering over the button, accepts. As she passes the homeless guy: Sorry, sorry... 38 . . 38 Frances runs back to the restaurant. Falls. Hard. Gets up and keeps running. 39 . . 39 The restaurant is considerably more cleared out. Frances has been gone a long time. She sits down plunks the money down, happy. Lev is on the phone. ’ll ask her and let you know...okay, man, see you. He hangs up. Sorry, that was Benji. You know, my Sophie. Frances is flushed and out of breath. You go to Switzerland? 25. (breathing heavy) Have been to Switzerland? No. No, did you go to -- mean, where were you? ’m sorry, had so much trouble finding -- She casually picks up the last bit of her wine and downs it. She puts her glass down, and wipes at her face with the napkin. She looks at the napkin, it has streaks of red. What the fuck? She tries to trace the blood up her arm to its source. You’re bleeding. can’t find it. Somewhere on your arm... She feels her arm, trying to figure it out. Her elbow. Shit. Sorry. Don’t apologize to me. Oh, damn it. Oh, let me, ’m going to go to the bathroom, just one second. 40 . ’ . . 40 Frances stands in their apartment. Totally enamored with it. This place is pretty awesome. Lev enters with a First Aid Kit. 26. ’m a First Responder. You didn’t have to do that. (opening the Bandaid) You’re injured. know, but ’m fine. He places the bandage on her arm. There. Like a boy scout... Sophie makes fun of me because can’t account for my bruises. We’re not living together anymore. Really? Yeah, ’m going to have to find a place to live. can’t afford to stay there alone. was kind of thinking Washington Heights...? (lighting a cigarette) The chick crashing in the little room might be moving to Portland next month. Oh, that’s good to know. (then) You smoke inside? Yeah, don’t you? No. Want to? 27. He offers her a cigarette. Lights it for her with a special lighter. This makes me feel like a bad mother in 1987. Wanna see my room? 41 . ’ . . 41 Frances is looking at the framed pictures on the wall. They are old and yellowed. Is this your family? Nope. They are quiet a little too long. Lev moves towards her and puts his hand on her shoulder. Frances glances at the hand, and instantly makes a face and a strange noise that is definitely negative. It’s something that if she had thought about for one second more that she wouldn’t have done. Lev moves away. They hear Benji come through the door. He has two girls with him. They make a lot of noise. #1 (..) Oh my ! This place is ! Benji’s home. 42 . ’ . . 42 . One girl dances to music. Lev plays cribbage with another girl. Flirting heavily with her - looking at her cards, teasing her. Benji and Frances are talking. Frances drinks a scotch out of a proper scotch glass. 28. love dance. dated a dancer in high school and her teacher said could have really had a future in it. (joking but serious) You liar. He’s a liar. No ’m not! Ask anyone from school! (to Frances) really to love dance. It’s pretty great... mean it’s a hard world, but - Do us a dance! feel weird... Just one move. Frances gets up does something quickly and sits back down. That was ! You should be in this music video my friend is working on. ’ll hook you guys up. (to herself) You guys are...like magic. Is Noodle Champion still open? ’m starving. don’t think so... All we have is...we have eggs. want something . And to me. 29. Wait! 43 . ’ . . 43 Frances has the stove going with a couple of items. 44 . ’ . . 44 Frances serves everyone omelettes prettily. People compliment her and the food. It’s Sophie’s recipe, but... She does a little twirl of happiness. 45 . ’ . . . 45 The other two girls leave. Kiss everyone on the cheek. (to his girl) ’ll call you. We’ll shoot some pigeons. And ’ll let you know about my show. #2 Yes! Please! love your hair. Thanks. 46 Everyone’s gone, Frances moves to the couch between Lev 46 and Benji. This is the best night ’ve had since Sophie dumped me. She basks in it. (nods, half-hearted) should probably go, too. Make a left and a left out of the building and the is on the other side of the bridge on East Broadway. 30. You’ll see a 99 Cent Store -- Okay, yeah. should go. (beat, indicating the extra room) Is that chick really moving to Portland? Yeah. Before you go, do another dance. (this time eager) Ok! She gets up and starts to dance. The boys love it. * Revision (05/14/2012) 31. 47 . . . 47 Music swells. Frances runs through the streets of Chinatown, bomber jacket and backpack on. She’s running, almost dancing through the streets. She bursts into the apartment. 48 . . . 48 Frances is asleep. She hears people having sex. She opens her eyes, stirs. Closes her eyes. : 49 The two boys, Benji and Lev, run into the bedroom and 49 jump on top of her bed, play-tickling her and body slamming her. It’s morning. 50 . . 50 Benji on his computer, smoking a cigarette. Still in a Tshirt and pajama bottoms. Frances on her computer, backpack on, ready to leave. Both drinking Folgers instant coffee.

Lev has come out of his room. Fully dressed, bare feet. girl, Nessa, trails after him. She’s about twenty. Very thin. Not wearing pants, just underwear and a big tshirt. Guys. This is Nessa. Hey.

Thanks though. wanted to go to the Met and drop this laundry off and need to deposit a check, a whole...Sunday planned. 51 . . 51 Frances eats a very large egg bagel very quickly. So quickly that she nearly chokes. Her backpack is now off. She notices how much faster she’s eating than everyone else. Slows down. Or tries to. Why do you all live together? Well, knew Benji through Sophie and - Where is Sophie these days? Busy with work. 33. (') Which Sophie? Sophie Kozak? Get out! fucked her little brother! Oh, yeah, you fucked Thomas? You fucked who? (to Frances) How do you know her? We went to college together and we’re...we were born together. Oh you’re that Frances. Who is Thomas? Not really but that’s what we say.

You have an older face... ...but like you don’t have your shit together. 52 . . . 52 Frances lays on the couch, shoes off. Benji still on the computer. Lev is standing by the door, holding a motorcycle helmet. (a little sadly) Nessa can’t come from sex. Only sixty-nine. That’s a crazy helmet. Got to. Motorcycle law. Oh, can you leave that rent check for me? Yeah, yeah, sorry. ’ll put it on your desk. It’s for...$950? Nope. $1200. ... don’t, thought we said $950 when moved in. Nope. The whole space is $4000 but the little room is only $1200 But, -- 36. No, she’s right. We said she could pay that much until she got more cash together. Remember because when do the Christmas show ’ll make more because ’ll be doing like ten shows a week... Oh right right. So we’re good with $950? That’s okay? ’m really sorry... He puts down his motorcycle visor. No prob. Catch you on the flipside! Lev leaves. He leaves so easily... Transportation is his thing. Bike, skateboard. He has a car, too. can’t even get out of the house on my feet! She is quietly dejected. You know what Virginia Woolf book this reminds me of? Frances: . Frances laughs. Wanna watch a movie? Now? 37.

Let’s do something fun. We could go to a movie. Movies are so expensive now... should be saving so can pay full rent. ’m not going to force you. (getting up, ready) have to work out, at least. cannot get fat. Frances puts on shoes, etc. Benji drinks his scotch and starts going through his records to pick one. 38. Do look old to you? No. Yes. How old? Older than am? Older than twentyseven? No. Twenty-seven is old, though. 53 : It’s dark out. Benji and Frances watch a movie. 53 Benji smokes and eats an egg roll. Frances wolfs down a box of General Tso’s Chicken. She realizes she’s eating too fast - tries to slow down. 54 . ’ . 54 Sophie looks at the stuff. Frances bobs next to her. Isn’t this place ? Is that an Eames chair? Yeah, isn’t this ?! Total rich-kid apartment. The boys just have good eyes. They find stuff all the time. Do you know who Lev Shapiro’s dad is? He doesn’t get along with his dad...Lev and Benji are artists. Exactly -- the only people who can afford to be artists in New York are rich. ’m an artist. ’m not rich. 39. You are rare. (beat) It’s just this apartment is very...aware of itself. (defensively) Everyone who comes here loves it. love it. The three of us are hilarious together. We’re like a sitcom. My Two Husbands. (softening) No, that sounds great. ’m really happy for you, Frances. (a tad bitchy) Thank you, Sophie. Sophie sits beside her on the couch. Puts her head on Frances’s shoulder. Lev comes through the door. Ladies! Lev Shapiro! You know Sophie. Of course. Still beautiful. Kisses her hand. Sophie giggles. Frances looks thrilled. How is the publishing business? You know. Not good. How’s sculpture? Amazing. Oh my boyfriend likes that artist you work for... 40. Tell your boyfriend he can always talk to me if he wants to buy something. will. (to herself) Are we buying art now? Is that the point we’re at? need to clean up. Ladies. Bye! Lev retreats into his bedroom. Lev would totally date you. have a boyfriend. But isn’t he charming? And so handsome? You could be over here all the time, it would be . You wouldn’t have to spend all that time with Phoebe. (laughs) Right, could fuck him just to not hang out with Phoebe! Lev walks across the living room in just a towel. Don’t mind me. ’m just trying to get your attention. Lev goes into the bathroom. The shower turns on. How could you not want to date him? He’s kind of magic. Because ’m with Patch. 41. Patch is the kind of guy who buys a black leather couch and is like “ love it.” Sophie doesn’t react. Frances gets up. Starts trying to do a headstand. What are we doing with our day? have to get going around five, so guess should leave at -- thought we were hanging out. We are. All day. have plans with Patch tonight. told you. don’t remember that. texted that to you. No you didn’t. Yes did. Here -- Sophie gets out her phone, starts scrolling. We’re not doing that. That’s shitty. It’s not court. did text you, though. believe you. 42. You don’t have to believe me, did text you. She holds out her phone. Do you want to see my room? 55 . ’ 55 Sophie and Frances in her room. They flop down on the bed. kind of have a crush on this boy, but his name is Georgie so don’t know how far it’s going to go. Can’t fuck a Georgie. “ want you inside me Georgie.” Have you been dating anyone? Nope. Oh, Frances. It’s fine. What about Benji? Benji thinks ’m undateable. It’s really funny when he does it. (indicating her and Sophie) You and are both undateable. Guys can’t handle us. We are going to be spinsters. Better break that to Patch. 43. Boys are easier. Girls are passive aggressive, boys are just like “clean up your shit.” (looking around) You’re still messy... ’ve been busy. No, it wasn’t a criticism, meant it in a nice way. You will always be messy and you will always look at yourself too much in the mirror. When do look at myself in the mirror? Always -- you just were doing it. There are so many mirrors in this apartment! don’t want you to change. like your clothes everywhere and your mirror thing -- it’s sweet. You have stuff, too. What? You judge people who aren’t as moderate as you are. do not. Yes you do. And you don’t read. Just then, Benji comes running into the room and leaps into bed with them. 44. Hey bitches! Oh my God, Benji! You’re crazy! 56 : It’s night. Benji and Frances watch a movie. 56 (suddenly) wish we had cookies. (pause) wish we had Chessmen. The front door opens. Lev and a dark haired, long legged girl enter. Different girl than Nessa. Hey guys. (to girl) Wanna see my room? They walk in front of the and into his room. 57 . . . 57 Frances performs in a piece with a troupe. She’s in the back, but she’s in it. She is really, really dancing her heart out. Very happy. 58 . . . 58 Frances is one of the last ones to get her stuff out. Colleen comes in. Sorry! ’m so slow! have trouble leaving places! You looked great tonight. Thanks! Frances, wanted to tell you so you had some days to process it - we won’t be able to use you in the Christmas show. ’m really sorry. What? 45. ’m really sorry -- you know what bad shape the company is in. (tearing up) know. (gently) We can talk about next steps when we’re back in February. Am fired? No! just, like you and want to talk to you about the future and make sure it’s what you want. want to be in the company. know. Frances is crushed. Take your time. Yeah. will. can’t help it. 59 . . . 59 Frances walks across the deserted stage. Takes a selfconsciously sad moment. 60 . . . . 60 Most people are gone. few stragglers remain. Frances sees Sophie. Runs to her, hugs her. (thrilled) Oh, my love, ’m so glad you’re here! You were great, really great. 46. Could you see me? Yeah, we were on the risers, so we could see to the back. Who? Patch walks up. Sorry, had to take a leak. Congratulations! Frances face hardens. Thank you. Patch doesn’t pick up on anything. Should we all go out for a quick drink? “quick” drink? We have to get up early tomorrow. Tomorrow is Saturday. We have to catch a flight in the morning -- we’re meeting my parents in the Galapagos. (trying to connect to Frances) haven’t packed. You know me. Last Minute Mabel. Ronald Rule Follower. They are doing a routine. He does this weird kind of strangle motion and she acts like she’s getting strangled. Frances just stares at them. 47. 61 . . . 61 Frances, Patch and Sophie sit in a corner. It’s kind of a douche-y club/bar. The waitress comes up. ’ll have a glass of -- -- We’ll get a bottle of your most expensive vodka for the table. And then all the stuff that comes with it. Very good. She leaves. Patch laughs and rubs his hands together uncomfortably. 62 . . . . 62 Frances is doing shots. Patch and Sophie sip on their drinks. (very drunk) want us to be a family, you know? can be part of your family, don’t you think? Patch love you. want to love you. But need you to get drunk. The waitress comes back. How are we doing over here. We’re good. Bring the check, we’ll finish the bottle. Sophie? Yes. Sophie come with me. Where? 48. Bathroom. Really? Are we still doing this? Frances is pulling Sophie away. Patch, you got this? Um, yep. 63 . . . 63 Frances and Sophie inside a stall together. Frances sits on the toilet. was lying. don’t love Patch. do love him. Since when? When did this happen? It’s been happening. That’s fucking . . . No, you’re bullshit. And you’re making me feel really bad right now. want to love him if you love him but you don’t love him. . (tearing up) . fucking held your head when you cried bought special milk for you know where you hide your pills do not treat me like a three hour brunch friend. 49. ’m not talking to you while you’re like this. Frances hits the wall close to Sophie’s head. It’s violent and kind of scary. 64 . . . . 64 Sophie two steps ahead of Frances, rushing back to the table. She starts gathering her things. So does Frances. (to Patch) We have to go. ’m going. (to Sophie) We can stay if you want. ’ . (to Patch) ’mon, get your stuff. Frances gets angry. ’ . . They sit. (putting on a act) Enjoy the Galapagos. am also going on a vacation. long one. ’ll set up my email so it sends out a vacation email. And my voicemail will also say ’m on vacation. So if you get that, Sophie, don’t worry, ’m on a vacation. ’ll try to give you a call when get back, okay? Thanks, guys. This was great. Frances shoves the bottle of vodka into her purse and takes off. 50. 65 . . . 65 The bottle of vodka that Frances took is sitting on her dresser. All the lights are on. Frances is visibly upset. She is putting away all the clothes in her room, trying to straighten up, make a neatness. She looks at herself in the mirror for one second, catches herself doing it, and looks away. Benji appears in the door watching her. You’re cleaning! (defensively) ’m not messy, ’m busy! Benji is inside the room. He sits on the bed. Frances looks at it, discouraged. don’t make my bed. Sophie always made the bed. She keeps cleaning. ’m glad you’re home. had a shitty night. Sorry kid. had a great night. cracked the second act of my script. ’m on page 68. That’s exciting. Is that for ? No, this is s sample script ’m writing for the fourth Beverly Hills Cop. (smiles) Boy trouble tonight? Sophie trouble... Undateable. 51. And kind of, don’t know, got temporarily fired. ’ve been fired like a million times! It makes you cool! (dejected) Yeah. But without the Christmas show, can’t pay... (then) Do you have any good tunes? (clearly pleased) Wait right there! He gets his iPod and big headphones. He puts them on her. It’s a jammer. (too loudly) It’s great. know. He does that thing where he looks at her too intensely while she’s listening, trying to figure out what part of the song she’s on. She takes them off. love it. Put it on my mix. He puts the headphones back on, wanting her to listen to the song. Aren’t these headphones tits? just got them. They’re super-duper noise cancelling. So don’t have to hear Lev fuck. She takes them off again-- Ha. --he tries to push them back on, she shoves them back to him and goes back to cleaning. 52. Lev and were talking about getting a maid to come in once a week. maid? Yeah, it’s not that expensive, like $400 bucks a month? Frances cleans drunkenly, thoughtfully. Do you know that ’m actually poor? You aren’t poor. There are poor people. You aren’t one of them. Yes, but it’s, mean, you’d feel poor if you had as little money as do. But you’re not poor. That’s offensive to actual poor people. Yeah, guess that’s true. Frances keeps cleaning. Benji considers something. You want -- you want to hear something hilarious? Yes. Lev thinks we’re going to end up married. ’m too tall to marry. Ha! You are. 53. That’s so funny. Why would he think that? did want to sleep with you when first met you. (quickly) But now - totally undateable! guess we are like a married couple in a way. We talk. We don’t have sex. Yeah. We get along super well. Sophie and used to be like that, too. But Sophie was a girl. And you were both straight. So it had less, like, real world probability. Frances yawns. Right. Of course. Well. ’m done. hope don’t have the spins when lay down. Just lay on your back by the edge of the bed and put one foot on the floor. It helps. Frances nods. Benji reluctantly gets off the bed. Goodnight, then. Night. Good luck with Beverly Hills Cop. Four. Benji walks towards the door. 54. Open? Shut? Um, shut. think. don’t know. Does it matter? ’ll leave it open so if you need to throw up or cry or something you can call me. Thanks. Yeah. Open. He’s gone. Frances sits down on the bed. She looks towards the mirror and self-indulgently stares at herself. 55. : 66 . . . 66 The office is vaguely Christmas-y, maybe a wreath somewhere. Frances walks down the hallway, a creepy long hallway with a lot of people’s stuff behind metal. She is carrying a chair. 67 . . . 67 Frances stands on the corner with the chair. It’s cold out. student-looking person walks by. Frances approaches her with the chair. The student rejects the chair. 68 . . . 68 Frances sits on the chair and writes something on a piece of card board. Gets up and puts the cardboard paper on it. It reads: Free Chair. Totally normal, really. Didn’t fit in storage space. Needs a home. : The following moments occur as silent scenes of a Sacramento Christmas.

The Society is really more like a multi-purpose cafeteria type of room with fold out chairs and hippie-ish banners. 56. Frances going around with her parents and shaking the hands of older people she used to know. 72 . . . 72 Frances rides her bike through the streets of Sacramento. 73 . . . . 73 Frances lies in the tub, not moving, eyes closed.

Christmas towels. 74 . . . 74 Frances and her parents walk along a special street in Sacramento that has of Christmas lights and decorations. 75 . . . 75 Christmas “dinner” - really late lunch: About twenty people crammed around a table. The table doesn’t quite fit everyone so there is a card table set up as an extension. Frances’ dad is carving and serving. Frances gets happy drunk. There are so many people and so much happiness that the windows fog up. 76 . . . 76 Frances’ and her Dad walk the dog on the levee along the river. 77 . . . 77 Frances’ Dad takes down the Christmas lights. 78 . . . 78 Frances’ helps her Mom pack away ornaments. 79 . . . 79 Frances sits in the back of the car with her Mom and Dad in the front, the dog in her lap. 80 . ’ . . 80 Frances checks in, hugs her parents.

She cries all the way through security and onto the plane. . 57. 81 . . 81 Frances is carrying a sleeping bag and a rolling suitcase and her backpack. Stop thanking me. It just means a lot, letting me stay with you-- want you to know. You will definitely be getting a thank-you note. Remind me to get your address in my e-mail. Don’t worry. It’s the only thing that’s forever. -mail. They walk along in silence. Hey! Have you ever done--where you sing and--the other... It’s easier to just do it, okay? You sing, make up some songs about whatever, and ’ll dance... Why? Oh for money, kind of, so if you see someone then just shout “ !” don’t want to. ’ll sing and you dance, if you want. We don’t need money like that. It’s not for money. think it’s good to feel stupid sometimes. Did you see that movie, Once? 58. ’ve worked in homeless shelters and it’s not funny to make fun of people who have to beg and panhandle. Panhandle sounds old fashioned. Rachel looks annoyed. ’m not making fun. Just watch me do it for a second. Frances launches into singing and dancing while Rachel just stands there. Someone walks by and Frances screams: . (staring) This is making me very uncomfortable. (suddenly stops) It’s stupid. Sorry. They walk along again in silence. Do you want to put on really fancy clothes and then go steal stuff from Sephora? Rachel says nothing. Sorry about that. Thank you. You’re welcome. (..) Oh my God, she’s like the most beautiful creature! 82 . ’ . . 82 on a picture of a baby on an iPhone. Nadia passes the iPhone to Spencer. 59. Wow. That’s a healthy little girl. It’s a six person dinner party. Spencer and Nadia, 30’s, Janelle, and Andy, 40’s, Rachel and Frances. Frances is under-dressed, wearing her jacket, backpack. She awkwardly sits at the head of the table. She’s in the 90 percentile for height and 95 for weight. But it evens out later. When they walk. It doesn’t mean she’ll be fat. Spencer hands it to Frances. She fiddles around on the phone. Oh, think you’re getting a call. She hands the phone to Andy who checks it and puts it in his pocket. It’s so funny when people have kids and they’re all “ used to be so focussed on ‘me’ and now ’m totally not” - it’s like, ! It’s still you. It’s a mini you! It’s a half you! mean, you made it! (eating too fast) forgot to eat today. Pockets of conversation: The only time you ever hear the phrase “’m not here to make friends” is on reality television. Andy starts to pour Frances wine. She puts her hand over the glass, some splashing on her fingers. Oh...sorry. ’m trying not to drink right now. 60. Oh, ’m sorry. Don’t be sorry. You’re not the one who’s bat-shit crazy after four vodkas. Yeah...Nadia had a hard time giving it up while she was pregnant. What do you do? What? “What do you do?” It’s such a stupid question thought ’d ask it. Oh, ’m a lawyer. What do you do? What a stupid question! Just kidding...it’s, it’s hard to explain. Because what you do is complicated? No...because don’t really do it? Suddenly all conversation has stopped and everyone has turned to Frances. Well, ’m a dancer, guess. Frances and are in the same company. But Rachel’s in the main company. ’m an apprentice. Hopefully the * touring company soon. * (to Rachel) have a meeting with Colleen on Monday morning. Revision (05/14/2012) 61. Cool. (to the table, rambling) But ’m doing really good. Rachel and have a really cool place. Or Rachel does and ’m staying there for six-ish weeks. * Five. * * Right.

But, yeah, everything is up in the air. like being alone. just got back from Sacramento. Andy and Janelle just got back from Paris. Six and half hours on a plane with a baby. Won’t be doing that again soon! But it was heaven. (to Frances) Do you ever get to Paris? Not really. No. Kind of once. Actually, no. What’s that museum with the escalators in tubes? The Pompidou. Yeah! (beat) Um, do you get there? Revision (05/14/2012) 62. They have a great place in the 6th. It’s a little pied a terre. Literally! --but it’s a really special place.

One of my friends from college, Abby, who moved there because her boyfriend works for a bank. In school, she was on of the top five friends, but then Zoe became closer to our friend group and Abby kind of moved to the outer ring. Everyone at the table listens politely. Rachel could give two shits. Sophie and Abby never totally got along. She started dating Luke who always thought would have dated any of us, but he ended up with Abby. Silence. Well, let me know if you’re ever there, we like for it to be used. Oh okay... don’t see myself probably getting there super soon, but...thanks, thanks. 63. Frances, think you know one of my colleagues at Goldman, Reade “Patch” Krause. * Oh, yeah, know Patch! ‘Sup bra? Mm.

She seems like she reads a lot to me. read way more. Uh huh. Frances hesitates, hating herself in this conversation. Revision (05/14/2012) 64. don’t know why ’m shit-talking Sophie. She’s basically the best person know. Crazy, though, right? Yeah. Which thing? Japan. Japan? They’re moving to Japan in a couple * of weeks. * What? Patch got transferred. It’s a really cool position. . * For how long? Indefinite. But Sophie has a job at Random House. She quit. on Frances’ face as it changes, pained and sad and everything bad all at once. Conversation turns to other things, travel plans, airlines, food. Frances reaches for the wine and pours herself a steep glass. : 83 People have moved from the table and are now on the 83 terrace. Frances smokes. She’s drunk. She talks to Nadia. Revision (05/14/2012) 65. Nadia, want this one moment...it’s what want in a relationship, which might explain why ’m single now ha ha. It’s hard to...it’s like that thing where you are with someone and you love them and they know it, and they love you and you know it but it’s a party and you’re both talking to other people and laughing and shining and you look across the room and catch each other’s eye not because you are possessive or that it’s precisely sexual but because that is your person in this life. And it’s funny and sad, but only because this life will end, and it’s a secret world that no one else knows about that exists right there in public unnoticed - sort of like how they say other dimensions exist all around us but we don’t have the ability to perceive them. That’s...that’s what want out of a relationship. Or just life, guess. Love. Blah, sound stoned. ’m not stoned. (suddenly) Thanks for dinner. Bye! Oh...bye. Frances grabs her backpack. Rachel catches her. * Where the fuck are you going? Oh, ’m kind of wasted. was going to go home. Is that okay? don’t care, was just kidding. (pause, to the group) * Thanks for inviting me tonight. * * Nice to have met you. Revision (05/14/2012) 66. * Lovely. * * (suddenly) Hey, Andy, actually, think might be going to Paris this weekend. Really? Oh... (pause) Do you want to stay in our apartment? Yes. Okay. Wonderful. ’ll get you the information. Wonderful. Rachel is staring at her oddly. 84 . . . 84 Frances walks. It’s cold.

Benji smiles warmly. Well, kid. We’ve got to run. Nice meeting you. You, too. You’re very pretty. Thank you? See you around, weirdo. He ruffles her hair. He and Caroline take each other’s hands and walk off. Frances feels odd - not jealous, exactly, but confused.

The following actor's line will be started with a to indicate that it is interrupting another line. When the text is in , it indicates that it is the past timeline, which begins in Winter of 1861. When the text is in , it indicates that it is the present timeline, which begins in Fall of 1868. Both timelines move forward from their origin point. . . . 1868. , our heroine, hesitates. In the half-light of a dim hallway, she exhales and prepares, her head bowed like a boxer about to go into the ring. She puts her hand on the doorknob. pause, and then, she opens it onto a disorderly room. It is full of men. Some sit with their feet up on the desks, higher than their hats, which they do not remove for her. They smoke and read, hardly noticing that she has walked in. Jo walks through the desks, looking for one in particular. (clearing her throat) Excuse me. . (the oldest, smokiest gentleman) looks at her. (') was looking for the Weekly Volcano office... wished to see Mr. Dashwood? Mr. Dashwood stares silently. (') (nervous, presenting pages) friend of mine desired me to offer a story, by her, she wrote it - she’d be glad to write more if this suits. He stands and extends his rough, large hand. She gives him the manuscript. . (turning the pages over) Not a first attempt, take it? No, sir; she has sold to “Olympic” and “Scandal” and got a prize for a tale in the “Blarney Stone Banner.” . prize? (weakly) Yes. 2. He now takes in Jo’s appearance and her mended clothes. . Sit. Jo sits, hands folded, trying to cover the ink stains. Mr. Dashwood reads her story with a pen in hand, gleefully crossing out and making notes, changes. Every time his pen scratches, Jo feels her heart breaking. She’s on the verge of tears when: . (') We’ll take this. (looking up) You will? . With alterations. It’s too long. She nods and he hands it back to her, page after page with her work crossed out. She examines it. You’ve cut - took care to have a few of my sinners repent. . The country just went through a war. People want to be amused, not preached at. Morals don’t sell nowadays. (pointedly) Perhaps mention that to your “friend.” Jo looks again at her completely altered story. What do you - that is, what compensation - . We pay twenty-five to thirty for things of this sort. We’ll pay twenty for that. (money over art) You can have it. Make the edits. Jo hands over the story, Mr. Dashwood hands over the money, business done. 3. (') (then) Should tell my, my friend that you’ll take another if she had one better than this? . We’ll look at it.

What name would she like put to the story? Oh, yes - none at all if you please. He considers her. . Just as she likes, of course. Good morning, sir. Good day. . . . . 1868. The streets of New York. After the Civil War and at the brink of The Industrial Revolution. It is a city in the middle of becoming, the 20th century on the horizon. Horses, trolleys, young, old, black, white, immigrants, returning soldiers, factory workers, wealthy industrialists, fashionable women and poor mothers all crowd the streets. We find Jo (also becoming) sprinting down the street with utter joy. She has pulled up her skirts and is running full steam. Not lady-running, flat-out . For the joy of it. 4. ./. . . . 1868. Jo reading and walking at the same time, bounding two-at-atime up the steps of a large brownstone boarding house. She stoops to pick up a cat who suns herself on the steps. (to the cat) My Beth would like you very much. As Jo walks through the house, into the drawing room, she lets the cat down, and goes straight to the fireplace. She stands with her back to it, to warm herself, and produces a small notebook and begins to write. She is so engrossed with her writing that she doesn’t hear the boisterous group of college students and professors, men and a few women, when they descend upon the room. She just keeps writing, until: (..) Good afternoon, Miss March. Jo looks up from her notebook to see looking down at her. He speaks with a French accent, and, like all Europeans, seems to know something that we Americans don’t: (she straightens up) Good afternoon, Professor. You’re on fire. Thank you. (suddenly animated) You’re on fire! Jo suddenly notices that the back of her dress has caught on fire. In a panic, another woman of the group helps her and the dress is put out. Disaster is avoided, although not humiliation. (laughing) have the same habit, you see? 5. He shows her scorch marks on his jacket. Jo is about to laugh when, . , the landlady, bustles into the room: . Kitty and Minny are waiting! Jo looks up the stairs to see the two little girls prancing. My students need me. Always working. (joke-dramatically) Money is the end and aim of my mercenary existence. No one gets ink stains like yours just out of a desire for money. Jo feels the intense pleasure and pain of being seen by someone, of knowing that they know you. (embarrassed, retreating) Well my sister Amy is in Paris, and until she marries someone obscenely wealthy, it’s up to me to keep the family afloat. Goodbye. (staring up after her) Goodbye. . . . . 1868. , an angelic 20-year-old with golden curls, is painting a staged scene, along with a few other young artists. It is a classic scene of two young men and a young woman at a picnic, and Amy is rendering it realistically, imitating the 18th & 19th century painters she loved. She looks at the painting of the young man next to her. He is doing something radically different - the paint is obvious, the colors are bright and un-life-like, space is flattened. It is not meant to be realistic: it is the beginning of modernism. She looks back at her own piece and realizes that she might have missed the moment that she came here to master. 6. Perhaps she’s already passed before her time. She continues working, troubled. . . . 1868. Amy rides in an open air carriage with , reading a letter from home. Everyone in Paris is out. Aunt March is only happy when she’s complaining, and she’s in excellent form this morning. It is the place to see and be seen and Amy March is doing both excellently. The decadents have ruined Paris, if you ask me. These French women couldn’t lift a hairbrush. No response from Amy. (') ! said, “These French women couldn’t lift a hairbrush.” Oh yes! Very true, Aunt March. Don’t humor me, girl. What do they write, your troublemaking family? Mother doesn’t say anything about Beth. feel should go back but they all say “stay.” You can do nothing if you go back. The girl is sick, not lonely. Amy gives her a hard look. (') And you shouldn’t go home until you and Fred Vaughn are properly engaged. Amy blushes and puts the letter away. Yes, and until ’ve completed all of my painting lessons, of course. Aunt March looks at her, momentarily confused. 7. What? Oh, yes, yes. Of course. Amy looks at all the passers-by. She sees a somber young man, tall and dark and looking down as he walks. Suddenly! ! ! ! Abandoning her primness, she launches out of the carriage and runs, nearly knocking people over. This is Theodore Laurence, , a 26-year-old without a sense of direction, like most 26-year-olds. They hug joyously and un-self-consciously: ! You’re so /grown up! /You wrote you’d come to the hotel! looked for you and couldn’t find /you anywhere! /You didn’t look hard enough! Maybe just didn’t recognize you, you’ve become so beaut/iful. (making a face) /Please don’t. thought you liked that sort of thing! . Where’s your Grandfather? Still in Germany. ’m on my own, traveling and /having fun. (teasing him) /and drinking and gambling and flirting... Don’t tell your mother! Are you chasing some young girl across Europe? (darkening) No. 8. (dropping her playfulness) ’m... couldn’t believe Jo turned you down. ’m so sorry. (crisp) Don’t be, Amy. ’m not. (..) ! ! ! (to Laurie) Oh, Aunt March! Laurie gallops over, and jumps into the carriage, kissing her: Aren’t we fine, /Ma’am. / ! He kisses her again, grinning. Il faut ! Allons-y! Aunt March attempts to get the carriage to leave, and Laurie is thrown off while Amy is thrown in. (calling after Laurie) Come to the New Year’s Party! It’s a ball and everyone will be there, including Fred - Pick me up at the hotel at eight - the Chavain! Dress for festivities! Top hats and silks! will! ’ll wear my best silk! Laurie turns and continues his heartbroken stroll, as Amy looks at him. She turns back to Aunt March. It’s Laurie! know. Amy turns around to get one last look at Laurie. She loves him, as she’s always loved him. 9. . . . 1868. , beautiful but with the melancholy of yearning emanating from her, is browsing the silks with Sallie Moffat, a rich young woman who possesses an air of casual boredom that comes from never having to work for what you have. (to the clerk) Twenty yards of the blue silk as well as the pink. Someone will be by for it later. She looks over at Meg, who touches a beautiful grey silk: (') Oh Meg! That would look so lovely on you. know just the dressmaker to send you to. You’ll be the prettiest wife in Concord. Oh no, John needs a new coat for winter and Daisy and Demi need new clothes and -- -- and his wife needs a new dress. (trying to hide her embarrassment) can’t... it’s, just can’t. He’ll be so pleased with how you look that he’ll forget all about the expense. (equivocating) don’t suppose it’s such an extravagance. Will twenty yards do? (deciding) Yes. Thank you. And Meg watches, delighted but fighting guilt, as the beautiful fabric is cut. 10. . ’ . . 1868. From inside a modest rural cottage, Meg emerges, wiping her hands and muttering to herself. (ashamed) Fifty dollars, what was thinking? She sees her two 3-year-olds, a boy and a girl, and , playing in the yard. She sits down to watch them, feeling both grateful and trapped. They run up to her. Mommy -- mommy! They fall into her arms, she accepts them and then sends them off to play again. We hear sounds a beautiful Bach piano sonata being played... . / . . 1868. ... the music grows louder as we see empty rooms of the childhood home -- the attic, the dining room, the stairs. Finally we find , alone at the piano. She stops playing suddenly, as if in pain. Then she takes a deep breath, feels the sunlight on her hand, and stretches it out. (..) Beth! Beth? She doesn’t respond. . . . 1868. Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night unfolds on stage. Jo is in the back, the cheap standing-room. She’s so wrapped up that she moves in until she’s practically leaning over the railing. It’s the scene where Viola (dressed as a man) seduces Olivia. ...That you do think you are not what you are. Then think you right, am not what am! Friedrich watches the play from his own, proper, seat. At a certain point, he sees Jo, and then watches her watching the play, her delight making him smile. 11. . . . 1868. The audience flows out of the theatre into the lobby. Jo, still in her theatrical reverie, spots Friedrich. She freezes, not moving, not wanting to be seen. She then follows behind the band of friends, drawn to them in spite of herself. . . . 1868. It is a rowdy and raucous crowd, drinking and dancing. Jo walks through the crowd, taking it in, watching Friedrich. He knows everyone and can speak half a dozen languages. Another man young, speaking a language Jo doesn’t know, offers his hand for the dance. ’m sorry, only speak English... Come dance! He pulls her into the dance, and she does her best to follow along. It’s whirling and loud and wild. Before long, she finds herself paired with Friedrich and all selfconsciousness leaves her. She is part of the night and the room and the music and she throws herself into movement, and we are taken back to.... . . . . & ’ . 1861. ...the sisters, all together again in the past, in the snowglobe of girlhood and memory that is ever present but forever gone, are in a flurry of getting ready for a holiday party. know just who ’ll dance with! Who will you dance with, Jo? You know never dance. can’t dance. Why can’t we all go to the party?! It’s not fair! Meg’s hair is covered in papers, and Jo manipulates a pair of hot tongs. Meg struggles to get on a pair of slippers. 12. Just wear your regular /shoes. (forcing it) /These fit last winter! Amy puts on jewels and rouge and tries to shape her nose. My nose will simply not look refined. (to no-one) like your nose. (reaching to Jo) Now, Jo -- -- don’t touch me, thanks! already feel ridiculous don’t want to look it! You could be pretty if you tried. Don’t want to, won’t do it. don’t want to go but wish could hear all the music. ’ll keep it all in my head and try to sing it for you when get home. Jo goes back to working on Meg’s hair. Beth watches Jo handle the tongs, amazed and slightly worried: Ought they to smoke /like that? (confident) /It’s the dampness drying. What a queer smell - it’s like... burnt feathers. There, now you’ll see a perfect little ringlet. 13. Jo removes the tongs, and a burnt clump of hair follows. Jo screams and Meg screams because Jo screams. (gasps, half delighted) You’re /ruined! /Why is her hair off? Meg, ’m so sorry! (looking in the mirror) What have you done?! /Marmee ’m spoilt! can’t go! My hair! /’m sorry! You shouldn’t have asked me to do it! ruin everything! . ' ’ . . . 1861. Meg and Jo walk down the hallway at the Gardiner’s very fancy party, the party already in full swing. Meg is chastising Jo: Don’t stare, don’t put your hands behind your back, don’t say Christopher Columbus, don’t say Capital, don’t shake hands, don’t whistle -- Meg is immediately pulled away. Meg March! You look so pretty! Sallie Moffat, at that moment Sallie Gardiner, pulls Meg away from Jo, who is left standing awkwardly. Meg... Meg seems to put on another face and attitude, more grown up and elegant. Jo fades away into the back of the party. . ’ ’ . . . 1861. Jo, 16, miserable, glumly watches the dancers. She pulls at a string on her dress. She catches Meg’s eyes, 17, laughing with her dance partner, and pleads with her to leave. Meg aggressively shakes her head, and Jo sighs, resigned. very large red-headed boy makes a beeline for Jo - in her terror, she looks for an escape. 14. She slips behind a curtain, and walking backwards, she nearly sits on Theodore Laurence (!), Laurie, a very serious looking 17-year-old boy. Dear me, didn’t know any one /was here! (rising) /Don’t mind me; stay, if you like. won’t disturb you? Not at all; don’t know many people, and felt rather strange at first, you know. So do . They stand there, unsure of what to do, both shy. Miss March, isn’t it? Yes, Mr. Laurence, but ’m not Miss March, ’m only Jo. And ’m not Mr. Laurence, ’m only Laurie. Their first burst of conversation has run it’s course, and they smile at each other, standing in the not-unpleasant awkwardness of meeting. Don’t you dance? don’t know how you do things here yet - you see, ’ve spent most of my life in Europe. ! That’s ! (she catches herself) shouldn’t use words like that. Says who? 15. Meg. She’s my older sister. They peek through the curtain and watch Meg dance. That’s her, see? The girl (looking) in the violet /dress? /Very pretty. She reminds me to be good so Father will be proud of me when he returns. Where is he? Volunteered for the Union Army. wanted to go fight with him. can’t get over my disappointment in being a girl. Laurie doesn’t look disappointed that she’s a girl at all: Jo ... would you like to dance? With me? can’t, because... Because what? You won’t tell? Never! scorched my dress, see? Meg told me to keep still, so no one would see it. You can laugh if you want to. It’s funny, know. Laurie does not laugh, but looks quite tender. Never mind that; ’ll tell you how we can manage. 16. . ’ ’ . . . 1861. Laurie bows, Jo awkwardly curtsies and then they go dancing wildly up and down a wrap-around porch. It’s actually very romantic in its exuberance. Sometimes Jo is the woman and sometimes the man - same with Laurie. They are mid-spin when they see Meg wildly gesture at them from inside: She’s hurt. My foot- ’ve hurt my ankle. . ’ ’ . . . 1861. Meg limps, Jo supports her and Laurie trails behind. How will get home?! don’t see what you can do except get a carriage or stay /here all night. /Carriages are too expensive. Well, let me take you. It’s right next door. No, thank you, we cannot accept. You must take mine. Please! No, it’s so early -- you can’t mean to leave yet. always leave early - do, truly. What choice do you have? ./. . . 1861. laughing Marmee, holding a book and covered in flour, opens the door on Laurie and Jo, supporting Meg. (laughing) Goodness gracious, what have you done! 17. Marmee has none of the pretensions of the other mothers, no artifice. She’s a hippie before they existed. The little girls, Amy and Beth come rushing down the stairs and attack the older girls. Here, make room, /Meg is a wounded soldier! / sprained my ankle dancing! Oh Meg - You’ll kill yourself for fashion one of these days. Hannah! We need ice! Tell us about it!/ (re: Laurie) What’s he like? (to Jo) /Was the music wonderful? Laurie stands apart, not wanting to be a disruption, but loving the March household, this slightly medieval utopia of artists and thinkers. Come in come in! Apologies for the chaos: enjoy baking in the middle of the night! Don’t mind the clutter, Mr. Laurence, we don’t. Laurie, please. (calling over) Can call you Teddy?! Yes! You must be part of the girls’ theatricals! (pointedly) ’m Amy. Hello. 18. They could use an extra player, although you’ll have to fight Jo for the male roles or play a girl. Here, have a scone. Marmee hands him the scone, as Hannah enters with ice for Meg’s ankle. Amy keeps sneaking looks at Laurie. (cracking herself up) Laurie, how are your ankles? Do you need ice? (laughing) No, thank you, ma’am. Instantly, she sees his loneliness, his lack of a mother. Oh, just call me Mother, or Marmee. Everyone does. He doesn’t say anything, but looks as if he’s about to cry. He doesn’t have a mother, and hasn’t had one for a long time. It really seems like being a fine young lady to come home from my party in a carriage and have maids to /wait on me! / don’t believe fine young ladies enjoy themselves a bit more than we do. The girls laugh and prance and gossip around the warm fire. He stands apart, loving them all, the whole family... . . . . ...but most especially Jo. As Laurie retreats back to his big, lonely house, he looks across the field to Jo, writing alone in the attic, absorbed with her work. . ./. . . 1868. Jo works with her writing costume on: an antique military jacket. Her writing is like an attack, moving into enemy territory and occupying space. Her hand starts to cramp, she shakes it, stretches it, and then switches hands. Suddenly she stops - she’s heard something. She opens the door, but the hallway is empty. She looks down and sees a book, a very beautiful copy of The Complete Works of William Shakespeare. She opens the cover - inside there is a note: 19. (read to camera) For the writer in the attic: Because you enjoyed the play so much tonight, wanted you to have this. It will help you study character and paint it with your pen. would love to read what you’re writing, if you’ll trust me. promise honesty and whatever intelligence can muster. Yours, Friedrich Jo opens the book and almost greedily she begins to read, reciting the words to herself. . . . 1868. gorgeous Paris ball, and Amy is lively and everyone’s favorite at the party. She dances with Fred Vaughn most often, gossips with his sister and her friends, and is charming to everyone. Suddenly, Amy sees something that makes her look sour, and we follow her gaze to see Laurie entering: He is loud, drunk, has two girls with him. They all fall into a sofa, laughing and loud. Amy frowns and approaches. She stands before him, annoyed: Laurie. (bleary, looking up) Amy. waited an hour for you. feel caught. Laurie clumsily makes a space for her while the other ladies depart. Amy does not, and walks away, forcing him to follow: Amy, please! Do you want to know what honestly think of you? 20. What do you honestly think of me? despise you. (almost laughing) Why do you despise me? Because with every chance for being good, useful and happy, you are faulty, lazy and /miserable. /Oh this is interesting. Selfish people do like to talk about themselves. Am selfish? Yes, very selfish. With your money, talent, beauty and /health -- /Beauty? - ah you like that, you old vanity - with all these good things to enjoy, you can find nothing to do but dawdle. He drunkenly puts his hand over hers. He wears a ring on his pinky finger, which he never takes off: (making fun of her) ’ll be good for you, Saint Amy, ’ll be good! Aren’t you ashamed of a hand like that? No, ’m not. 21. It looks like it’s never done a day of work in its life. And that ring is ridiculous. Jo gave me this ring. Amy considers him seriously. feel sorry for you, really do. just wish you’d bear it better. You don’t have to feel sorry for me, Amy. You’ll feel the same way one day. (with significance) No, ’d be respected if couldn’t be loved. (drunken meanness) And what work have you done lately, oh great “artiste” - or have you been too busy imagining how you’ll spend Fred Vaughn’s fortune? , ladies and gentlemen! Amy smarts, his comment cut her to the core. Laurie takes his very messy leave and she looks to Fred -- Fred, ’m, ’m so sorry. . . . . 1868. Friedrich holds a few newspaper clippings and handwritten pages. Jo paces and watches him read, nervous. He laughs, she smiles at his laughter. He finishes reading, puts down the work, and looks at her. Jo instantly feels that she needs to explain. Those are just stories, of course, but ’m working on a novel. And your novel, it will be like this? 22. Yes... so far /anyway. /With plots like this, duels and killing? It sells. Why don’t you sign your real name?

Honestly, think that they’re not good.

Jo, deeply offended, starts to gather up her work. can’t afford to starve on praise. Are you upset? 23. Of course ’m upset! You just told me you didn’t like my work! thought you wanted honesty.

But do you have anyone to take you seriously, to talk about your/work? /And who made you High Priest of what’s good and what’s bad? No one, and ’m not. Then why are you acting like it? Your reaction indicates that you must think there is some truth /in it. /My reaction indicates that you are a pompous blowhard. Shakespeare wrote for the masses.

If you know so much about it, why don’t you do it yourself? 24. ’m not a writer. don’t have the gifts you have. She does what she does when she’s hurt, which is that she gets incredibly mean instantaneously, without meaning to, and without being able to take it back. No, you don’t, and you’ll always be a critic, never an author, and the world will forget that you ever even lived /but no one.. (amused) /’m sure they will. But, ’ll be, but... Yes? (not sure of herself) No one will forget Jo March. can believe it. An energy between them and then she kills it definitively. We are not friends, you are not my friend. And don’t want your opinion because don’t like you very much so just don’t talk to me anymore, thank you. She turns to leave, hiding all the emotions. . . . 1868. Jo, in fury and confusion, walks the streets, letting her feelings burn out. She strides through the entire night that way, like Charles Dickens’ Night Walks. . . . 1869. After her walk -- Mrs. Kirke hands Jo a telegram: . Josephine, this came for you. Jo tears it open and quickly reads. 25. Dear Jo, Our Beth has taken a turn for the worse. Please, come home as soon as you can. (breathes, crumpling the note) Beth. . . . 1869. Jo drifts off to sleep, lulled by the movement. The country speeds past her. As she goes forward towards her childhood home that is now no longer her home, and to the past that she can no longer find... . . . . 1861. Jo March is sleeping in her large, cozy writing chair, a blanket wrapped around her. Her fingers are stained with ink and pages are strewn about her. Sounds of the day start to drift upstairs to her perch. Her eyes flutter open at the distant sound of... (..) Jo! Jo! Where /are you? (..) /Do you like these garlands? (..) They’re beautiful! Jo yawns and stretches and looks through the attic window out onto the snow-covered New England world: (whispered to herself) Merry Christmas, world. She wraps the blanket around her and quietly opens the attic door and sneaks down, watching her sisters, her heart’s joy, fussing over the decorations Amy has made. (calling out) Merry Christmas! They all look up, delighted: Jo! We’ve been up /for hours! /What have you been writing? Jo clomps down the stairs, pages of the play in her hand. 26. got carried away with our delicious revenge play last night. ! No, no poison it’s /Christmas. (flopping down) /Christmas won’t be Christmas without any presents. It’s so dreadful to be /poor. (injured) / don’t think it’s fair for some girls to have lots of pretty things and other girls nothing at all. At least we have father and mother and /each other. (glum) /We haven’t got father. And we won’t have him for as long as this war drags on. (putting down her sewing) wish had heaps of money and plenty of servants, so ’d never need to work again. You could be a proper actress on the boards! (privately delighted) can’t be an /actress. /They aren’t all fallen women. (prancing) have lots of wishes, but my favorite one is to be an artist and go to Paris and do fine pictures and be the best painter in the world. (cuddling up to Jo) That’s what you want too, isn’t it Jo? To be a famous writer? 27. Yes, but it sounds so crass when she says it. Why be ashamed of what you /want? /’m not! My wish is to have us all to be together with Father and Mother in this house - that’s what want. (under her breath) Beth is /perfect. /. What about your music, Queen Bess? (blushing) only do that for us, don’t need anyone else to hear it. (trying to shape her nose) You must not limit yourself. (standing, ending it) Mother proposed not having any presents this Christmas because our men are suffering in the army. We can’t do much, but we should make our little sacrifices and do it gladly. Don’t play mother just because she’s not home. Jo throws a pillow at Meg, it hits her squarely in the face. Don’t Jo; it’s so boyish. That’s why /do it. (disdainfully) / detest rude, unlady-like girls. hate affected little chits! 28. Jo tackles Amy and Beth and pulls in Meg. They commence playfighting. In the tussle, Amy shouts out: Watch my nose! My nose! It’s already no good! (entering) know you don’t care what think, but you don’t want your mother to find you like this, do you? The girls untangle and run to Hannah. She’s a good-natured woman old enough to be their grandmother. (kissing her) /You’re more family than Of course we care what /you wicked old Aunt March. think. Don’t, /Jo. /Where is Marmee? Goodness only knows. Some poor creature came a-beggin', and your ma went straight off to see what was needed. wish she could help other people at a time convenient to us. (holding her doll) Joanna and are very hungry. Dolls don’t get hungry, Beth. (holing up the pages) ’ve re-written the climax and we need to set it to memory. Amy, get the costumes. ’ve made a hat, and painted those old shoes blue /so she truly looks like a princess. / think the melancholy piece ’ve figured out is pretty good. Beth goes to the piano and Jo hands out the new pages: 29. Meg, wait until you see this /new speech! (marveling at the pages) / don’t see how you can write such splendid things, Jo! You’re a regular Shakespeare. Not quite. (to Amy) Miss Michelangelo, can you please rehearse the fainting scene? You’re as stiff as a poker /in that. (almost yelling) / can’t help it! never saw anyone faint and don’t choose to make myself all black and blue. If can go down easily, ’ll drop. If can’t, shall fall into a chair and be graceful; don’t care if Hugo does come at me with a pistol. Amy falls into a chair, and Jo turns to Hannah: Hannah... ’m not acting. didn’t even say anything! knew what you were going to say and ’m not acting. ./. . . . 1861. Marmee approaches her modest home, and sees her girls laughing and rehearsing, joyfully playing make-believe. She fights tears and sadness, about what, we don’t entirely know. We just know that what she does as a mother isn’t free. Of course it’s not, nothing is ever free, even a joy a mother can make. 30. Just before she flings open the door, she puts a smile on her face. Like so many mothers, she creates magic where there is none, and enables her girls to be brave. Merry Christmas, girls! All the girls shriek and crowd around her. (') ’m so glad to see you so happy. Mother! Are you freezing, /come have some tea. /Hannah and made these cakes. We finished the /sewing! /Wait until you see my portrait. They clearly worship their mother. As she’s talking, they follow her into the kitchen. Jo, you look tired - were you up again all night writing? Amy, come kiss me! How are my girls? ’m so /hungry! / could eat a horse. Stop it, /Jo! /Look at this breakfast! Marmee sees the expectant faces and wrestles with herself: What? What is it? Not far from here lives a poor young woman, Mrs. Hummel. Her five children are in one bed to keep from freezing, and there is nothing to eat. My girls, will you give them your breakfast as a Christmas present? They are very quiet, because they really don’t want to do it. 31. Is this where you say that Father would want us to? Yes. . . . . 1861. Mr. Laurence sits with his grandson, Laurie, his grandson’s tutor, Mr. Brooke. It is quiet and proper, the opposite of the merry mayhem of the March household. . (while being served) Thank you. (then to his host) And thank you, Mr. Laurence, for including me. . You’re welcome. Perhaps you could tutor my grandson in manners as well as mathematics. They both look at Laurie, who watches the March women walk across the snow-covered field with their breakfast. Jo hits Amy with a snowball, and there is a general tussle. (quietly to himself) What are they doing? . . . . 1861. All of the “proper” people of Concord are entering the local church, serving God in the traditional manner. The March family walks by, actually doing the Christ-like thing, instead of performing their faith. . . . 1861. The girls make their way through the woods and finally find themselves outside of a shack that is so dilapidated that it is hardly standing. This is the Hummel house. . . . 1861. The girls enter, tentative at first around such wretched poverty. Mrs. Hummel is barely older than they are, and frighteningly thin. Marmee shows no hesitation, immediately taking the infant into her arms. 32. . Ach, mein Gott! It is good angels come to us! ’m back! We brought food and blankets and sweaters. And we brought some medicine. These are my girls! They all set about making the room less wretched, more homelike. Marmee comforts the baby, Meg takes two children into her lap, Amy cleans and straightens, Beth covers the other children with blankets, Jo sets up the food. . . . 1861. Freezing but happy, the women return, and immediately see Hannah has arranged an unimaginable feast, with candy and ice cream and cakes. Hannah pulls Mrs. March aside while the girls marvel: Is it /fairies? /Santa Claus. No, it’s old Aunt March! Mr. Laurence sent it. (surprised) The Laurence boy’s grandfather? Why? He saw you giving your Christmas breakfast away and wanted you to enjoy the day. They all run to the window to look. But thought he was a mean old man! That’s so generous of him. 33. His grandson Laurie put the idea into his head! know he did. We should make friends with him. Boys scare me. And that big old house scares me. (gorging on sweets) Jenny Snow says that Mr. Laurence disowned his son after he went off with an Italian woman, and now his grandson is an orphan and he spends all of his time in that house locked up with his tutor. (sharply) He is a very kind man who lost his little girl when she was only a child, and now his son as well. His daughter died? That’s so sad. But doesn’t Laurie just seem so romantic? He’s half Italian. What do you know? You’ve never spoken /to him! (touching their petals) /Flowers in winter. am not responsible for this feast, but have got a surprise. /// letter! / from Father! / Is he coming home? / Three cheers! They gather around Marmee, sitting her into her easy chair, and making her comfortable. This is clearly their tradition: Don’t wish could go... Poor Jo - we can’t give up our only /brother. /It must be very disagreeable to sleep in a tent. 34. Jo takes her position behind the chair. Jo stands in the back so we can’t see her /cry. (smacks her head) /So what if do? (on her mother’s lap) When will he come home? He will stay and do his work faithfully as long as he can, and we won’t ask for him back a minute sooner than he can be spared. (reading) “Give them all my dear love and a kiss. Tell them think of them by day, pray for them by night and find my best comfort in their affection at all times. As the letter is being read, we see the sisters put on the play they had been rehearsing. With Marmee and Hannah cheering them on, they perform for the neighborhood children. The children are entranced as Jo, dressed as Hugo, with a black beard, a mysterious cloak, boots and a sword, calls out: What ho! Minion! need thee! (..) ... year seems a very long time to wait before see them but remind them that while we wait we may all work, so that these hard days need not be wasted.... Meg enters as Hagar, the horrible old witch. smoke effect and a well done homemade costume make the audience gasp: Born of roses, fed on dew, What charms and potions canst thou brew? Jo mouths the words along with her - she’s written every one. (..) ... know they will be loving children to you, do their duty faithfully, fight their enemies bravely... 35. Amy, as the Sprite, appears on top of a poorly constructed “tree,” to give the illusion of “flying”: Hither come, from my airy home, afar in the silver moo -- ! In mid-speech and gesture, Amy falls with a loud crash: (breaking character) Don’t laugh! Act like it’s all right! Just keep going! Beth play! Beth is revealed playing and trying to keep a straight face, while the sisters scramble to keep the performance going. (..) ...and conquer themselves so beautifully... Princess Zara (Amy) and Roderigo (Meg) kneel before Don Pedro (Jo), as he pronounces them man and wife. Beth plays the final triumphant chords. Brava! Brava! The audience claps as the sisters bow - Jo gentlemanly, Meg demurely, Amy the diva, and Beth’s small quiet curtsy. One woman rises to her feet with her applause and shouts: (..) ....that when come back to them may be fonder and prouder than ever of my little women.” . . . . 1869. The whistle blows, Jo is being gently shaken awake. Your stop, ma’am. Thank you. . . /. . . 1869. Mrs. Kirke hangs laundry as Friedrich questions her: She’s gone? Why? 36. . don’t know. She just left. But she didn’t say if she was coming back? . We didn’t have a heart to heart, Professor. (to a maid) What are you doing? Why are you just sitting there? Go dust something. And what about the girls? She was the best teacher they ever had. know... Friedrich looks troubled and serious. . . . 1869. Jo, with her luggage, walks home on the familiar roads she knows so well. She breathes in the air and trudges onward. . . . . , 1862. The four girls are walking, bundled against the cold. The streets are more bustling, the atmosphere cozier. It is how childhood always is in memory -- brighter and better. They are back to the daily task of making a living. It’s so hard to go back to work after such /good times. / wish it was Christmas every day. Or New Year’s, wouldn’t that be exciting? We’re a bunch of ungrateful minxes! Don’t use such dreadful /expressions! / like good strong words that mean something. Well have to go to school and don’t have any limes. 37. Limes? The other girls are all trading pickled limes. ’m in debt. owe ever so many limes. (giving her a quarter) Will that /do? (to Meg) /What did you do that for? know what it is to want little things and feel less than other girls. Between that and the drawings should wipe out my debt. What /drawings? (defensive) /Nothing! Beth shudders. ’m just glad that mother doesn’t make me go to that school with all those girls... (reminded) Beth, after your shopping, need you to work your way through the new sums and spelling and ’ll check it all when get home. Meg looks at the sun, and speeds up. Hurry! ’ll be late! They break apart from each other at the fork in the road, Beth and Meg going one direction and Amy and Jo in another. . ' . . 1862. Jo hops over a fence and runs toward Aunt March’s house. . ’ . . 1862. Aunt March dozes, poodle in her lap, while Jo stands by the bookcase and surreptitiously reads her own book. 38. She turns the page, trying to be as quiet as possible, but Aunt March wakes up. (..) -/! (hiding her book) /Yes! Is there a reason you stopped reading Belsham? ’m sorry, ’ll continue. (examining her) You mind yourself, dearie, one day you’ll need me and you’ll wish you had behaved better. (carefully) Thank you, Aunt March, for your employment and many kindnesses, but intend to make my own way in the world. No one makes their own way, not really, least of all a woman. You’ll need to marry well. You are not married, Aunt /March. /Because was rich and made sure to keep my money. So the only way to be an unmarried woman is to be rich. Yes. But there are precious few ways for women to make money. That’s not true. You could run a cat house, or go on the stage. Practically the same thing. (says nothing) 39. (') Other than that, you’re right, precious few ways for women. That’s why you should heed me. So can get married. No, so you can live a better life than your poor mother has. Marmee loves her /life. /You don’t know what she loves. Your father cared more about educating freedmen’s children than taking care of his family. Yes, but he was right. It is possible to be right and foolish. don’t think so. Well, you’re not paid to think. (') (softening slightly) know you don’t care much about marriage now. can’t say blame you, but intend to go to Europe one more time, and need a companion. How would you like to be the person take? ’d like that more than anything! Then read and don’t sneak around. don’t like sneaks. . . . 1862. During a break, one of the school girls whispers to Amy: #1 President Lincoln. 40. No! Father is fighting for him. #2 My father says the war is a waste, we should just let them keep /their labor. (shocked) /It is immoral! #2 Everyone benefited from the system, including you Marches - why should only the south be punished? Perhaps we should all be punished. #1 The Marches love a cause. #3 Fine, just do Mr. Davis. don’t know if should. #1 ’ll wipe out your debt and give you five more limes besides. Amy is seduced, and instantly starts drawing the (very good and accurate) caricature. The girls giggle. Amy gets carried away, drawing a conversation bubble with words “My eye is upon you, young ladies.” More laughter. Suddenly, a shadow falls over them, and all the girls look up, scared, and move away. Amy, however, is too wrapped up in her drawing to notice. When she does, Mr. Davis looks down sternly at her. ./. . ’ . . 1862. Laurie tries very hard to study with his tutor, Mr. Brooke, but it is hopeless, Laurie keeps jumping up and distracting himself with something in the room. His most recent position is standing like a statue, perched on a chair. . Sit down. Sit down, Laurie. Latin is a privilege. Please, you have to learn this. can’t afford to lose this position. Just return to Cicero. But Laurie is staring out the window. 41. There’s a girl out there. . No, there is not. ! Mr. Brooke, there is a girl! He throws open the window and yells out: Hello there! Are you hurt? (sniffling but yelling) ’m Amy. Hello Amy, ’m Laurie! know. You brought my sister back from the dance - would have never sprained ankle, have lovely small feet. Best in my family. But can never go home again, ’m in such trouble. Look. She holds up her hand, which is red and bleeding a little. (') Mr. Davis hit me. . . . . 1862. Amy, her hand now bandaged, sits looking at an art book, pretending to be a very fine lady. (doing a voice) Tell the servants that want this painting purchased for me! ! Laurie laughs at this confident girl. Amy likes making him laugh. Mr. Brooke shakes his head, frustrated. servant enters, followed by Jo and Meg. (indicating Amy) She’s in here... 42. Meg goes instantly to Amy, while Jo gets distracted by all the books. Laurie stands when Jo enters: Jo! (bursting out) What richness! Theodore Lawrence you ought to be the happiest boy in the world! fellow can’t live on books alone. could. Meg is tending to Amy, and Mr. Brooke can’t help but stare at Meg, completely flummoxed by her beauty and goodness: What happened /little lamb? (suspicious, to Amy) /What did you do? (playing innocent) Just a drawing and then... Mr. Davis hit me. Amy starts crying again, holds up her hand. Meg has taken off her gloves and put them on a side table while she examines her sister’s outstretched hand. Mr. Brooke eyes the gloves, he’s drawn to the items so recently worn by Meg. Jo, who has been roaming the room, stops in front of a portrait of Mr. Laurence. Laurie follows her gaze. Christopher Columbus, look at that. That’s my grandfather. Are you scared of him? ’m not scared of anyone! He looks stern, but my grandfather was much more handsome. Unfortunately, during this speech, Mr. Laurence has entered with Mrs. March, unseen by Jo. Jo! We do not compare grandfathers! 43. Jo spins around and sees Mr. Laurence and her mother. . You think he’s more handsome, hey? Oh, no. You are very handsome. didn’t mean... . (cracking half a smile) knew your mother’s father. You’ve got his spirit. Thank you, sir. Marmee tends to Amy. You are not to attend that school any more. Good, that man has always been an idiot. Jo will teach you. ?! already teach Beth! You’re a good teacher. . (trying with Meg) Yes, women being taught at home is much more proper, believe. (turning to him) Only because the schools for women are so poor. . Indeed, quite right. wish all the girls would leave his horrible school and that he would die. 44. You did wrong, Amy, and there will be consequences. (to Laurie) Thank you so much for taking care of Amy. My girls do have a way of getting into mischief. So do ! (smiling) Then you should run over and we’ll take care of you. And please come here, whenever you’d like. And tell Beth to come /too. /! Beth would adore the piano! . Is she the quiet one? That’s our Beth. . (pretend business-like) Tell the little girl to use our piano. And Jo, borrow any book you’d like! And may come look /at the paintings? . (to Meg) /There is also a lovely greenhouse.. We must be going. Girls? // Thank you/ Please come over/Many thanks/Our apologies. The women leave and Mr. Brooke notices Meg has left her glove behind. . Oh, Miss Meg! You forgot your glove! 45. The men are left standing in the silence of their absence. Mr. Laurence breaks the spell: . Well, back to work, back to work. . . . . 1869. Jo looks towards the Laurence’s house, which is dark, shutters closed. It doesn’t seem right without Laurie in it. She looks in the forest by the pond to find an old mailbox. She produces a key with a red ribbon and holds it in her hand, and we and she are transported back to.... . . . . 1862. Meg, Beth, Jo and Amy are all dressed as men, with hats and spectacles and pipes - Meg reading from the homemade newspaper in her lovely sonorous voice. (finishing) , written by Miss Jo March, will appear at the Barnville Theatre, in the course of the next few weeks, which will surpass anything ever seen before on the American stage. Starring the greatest actress from here to the Mississippi River, Miss Meg March. Meg— Good. Jo— Bad. Beth— Very Good. Amy— Middling. Excellent. Well done, sirs. Mr. President and gentlemen, wish to propose the admission of a new member. One who highly deserves the honor, would be deeply grateful, and would add immensely to the spirit of the club. propose Mr. Theodore Laurence! No! Absolutely not! 46. (breaking formality) Come now, let’s have him. He’s a real boy! We don't want any boys. This is a club for ladies. think we should to do it, even if we are afraid. say yes. It’s Laurie! Now then, everybody vote, and remember that it’s our Laurie and say “!” (reluctantly) Aye. Aye. And, as there is no time like the present! Jo throws open the doors of the closet, and Laurie is there, already dressed for the occasion of the meeting. You /traitor! /You rogue! Ladies, please - this is my stratagem, deserve the blame: Jo only gave into it after lots of teasing. Laurie bows deeply. Hear hear! merely wish to say, that as a slight token of my gratitude and as a means of promoting friendly relations between adjoining nations, propose this set of keys for a little post office ’ve made in the forest by the pond. (') 47. Allow me to present four copies of the key, and with many thanks for your favor, take my seat as part of the club. He lays the four keys (with different colored ribbons) before them and bows again and they all cheer. . . . . 1869. Jo holds the very same key and opens the post office box - nothing, of course. She shuts it back up and trudges across the field to her childhood home. . . . . 1869. Jo walks in the kitchen, and is immediately surrounded by Hannah, Meg, Marmee, and Demi and Daisy. They unload her bags and sit her in a chair and pepper her with questions. Hello! Thank God you’re home! Oh Jo ’ve missed you! We could have come to get you! (leaning down to the children) Daisy and Demi! You’ve gotten so big! wish you were here to teach them... (hugging Meg) ’m here now... It’s so good to have you home! think the loneliness got to Beth, though she ain’t said anything. Beth, where is Beth? Jo turns to Marmee, who shows the truth in her eyes. 48. She’s upstairs. Oh, my Jo. We all thought she was better but the fever had weakened her heart. Jo produces an envelope full of money. Take this and find her the best doctor you can. No, you need this money to live in New York. (shaking her head) ’m not going back. ’m using the rest to take her to the sea and get her strong. She hugs all the women again. When is Amy coming home? Marmee and Meg exchange glances. We didn’t want to worry her. (sharply) Does she not know? Beth insisted we not tell her because she didn’t want to ruin Amy’s trip. (rueful) Amy has always had a talent for getting out of the hard parts of life. Jo, don’t be angry with your sister... 49. . . . . 1862. Jo, in her and Meg’s room, places a pretty cover page on top of the novel she has written. She lovingly writes “For Father,” and hears: (..) Jo! Jo, where are you? can’t find my other glove! (hollering) ! Jo puts her novel carefully in a drawer that is filled with her finished writing, and closes it. (..) Jo we’re going to be late! Where are you going? (entering) You’re not invited. You are going somewhere with Laurie, know it! Yes, we are, now stop bothering. Do you have the tickets? Yes! Hurry up! You’re going to the theatre with Laurie. Meg, please, can come? ’m sorry, dear, but you weren’t invited. You can’t go Amy, so don’t be a baby and whine about it. 50. ’ve been shut up in here and never get to go anywhere. Beth has her piano but ’m so lonely! (from the piano) can teach you chords. don’t want chords, want to go to the /theatre! . think you’d hate to poke yourself in where you’re not wanted. We already have to deal with dull Mr. Brooke. like him, he’s kind. ’ll pay for myself! You will not come. ’m sorry, my sweet, but Jo is right. Next time. (leaving) Come, Meg, stop petting her! You’ll be sorry for this Jo March! You will! You’ll regret this! . . . 1862. Jo and Meg watch the play, which is a campy vaudeville kind of thing. They are completely engaged in the proceedings. The men are watching them: Laurie looks at Jo while Mr. Brooke looks at Meg. . ’ . . 1862. Amy sneaks into Jo and Meg’s room, searching every drawer and hiding place for the novel that she knows is there. She finally finds it in the bureau. She pulls out the novel that Jo has just lovingly placed there. . . . 1862. As they leave the theatre, Mr. Brooke offers Meg his arm, and she takes it. Jo notices and doesn’t like it at all. 51. Laurie sees Jo’s expression and offers his own arm in mock chivalry. She punches him in the shoulder, and then races up, taking her sister’s other arm, pulling her away from Mr. Brooke. . . . 1862. Amy places page after page into the fire, watching it burn, and feeling nothing but terrific about it. . . . 1862. Meg and Jo waltz in. Beth is playing with her dolls and Amy is sitting and reading, suspiciously quiet. Jo sprints upstairs. (yelling down as she runs up the stairs) Meg you’re a million times better than she was - although she was a terrific fainter! (musing to herself) wonder how she managed to turn white /as she did? (..) /Ugh, that Mr. Brooke, could he be any more... obsequious? (hollering back) thought he was very wellmannered. (from upstairs) Hold on, let me just get this idea down. Beth what’s your favorite eye color? (quickly) Purple. (wrapped up in her own story) Mr. Brooke has blue eyes and an old soul which is much more important than money. Jo re-appears, walking slowly. 52. Has anyone taken my novel? No. No. Why? Amy starts reading even more intently than before. Amy... you’ve got it. No haven’t. (grabbing her shoulders) That’s a lie! It isn’t! haven’t got it - don’t know where it is and don’t care. Tell me or /’ll make you! (trying to hold her back) /Jo, don’t! (calling) ! ! ! ’ ! You wicked girl! You wicked, wicked girl! can never write it again! ’ll never forgive you as long as live! They are fighting, full-out fighting, during these last lines, as their sisters and Marmee attempt to stop it. . ’ . . 1862. Jo is weeping, Beth cradling her head, Meg holds her hand. Marmee enters with Amy, who looks penitent. Marmee nods at her, as if to say “go ahead”: ’m sorry, Jo. 53. Nothing from Jo. Amy... (a rush of words) It’s just that the only thing you care about is your writing so it’s not as if could hurt you by ruining one of your dresses. And really did want to hurt you. (') am the most sorry for it now. ’m so sorry. Marmee approaches the bed. Don’t let the sun go down on your anger. Forgive her. Help each other, and you begin again tomorrow. (running from the room) She doesn’t deserve my forgiveness. will hate her! will hate her forever! . . . . 1862. very tense breakfast: Jo’s eyes are red and puffy and a remorseful Amy tries to sit beside her and make peace, but Jo changes seats away from her. Amy looks pleadingly at Meg. Laurie bursts open the back door, unaware of all the trouble. Good morning ladies! It’s brisk and brilliant and think the last day for the river - get your ice skates! Jo springs up, thrilled to have something to do. One second! Go down, and ’ll /be right there! / want to come too! Last time you promised could go! Jo, not acknowledging her, grabs her skates and races out. 54. (wailing) Is she going to be like this forever?! It was a very hard loss /for her. /Is there nothing can do? (conspiratorially) Go after her. Don't say anything till Jo has got good-natured with Laurie, then take a quiet minute and just kiss her, or do some kind thing, and 'm sure she'll be friends again. Heartened, Amy grabs her skates. . . . 1862. Amy runs out of the house, calling: Wait for me! Please! Jo pretends not to hear, skating near the edge while Laurie tests the ice. Amy is just getting to the riverbank, waving and calling. Hello! Wait for me! Stay near the edge, it’s not safe in the middle! Jo hesitates for a moment, and looks at Amy, who struggles with her skates - it’s not clear whether or not she heard Laurie. Jo opens her mouth to say something, but changes her mind. The anger in her heart has made her small and mean. (to Jo, not seeing Amy) Ready? Jo takes off down the ice, jumping the gun, Laurie racing after her. Meanwhile, Amy tentatively steps onto the ice. She begins gliding, arms out, a younger and less experienced skater. 55. Farther along the river, Laurie and Jo are trying tricks and spins, when Jo suddenly feels a pang of guilt, but shoves her feelings down and races to catch Laurie. She plows into Laurie, toppling him. They are both laughing when just at that moment - . The sound of ice splitting. And a high pitched scream: (..) ! ! Laurie and Jo freeze and look at each other, and in the same instant they scramble up, Jo screaming. Amy! It’s ! They race back, Jo sending up a breathless prayer, an incantation, a pleading with the universe: Oh god, oh god, dear god please... They find Amy surfacing and screaming and then going back under. Jo is almost paralyzed with terror... No... no... ... but Laurie has leapt to action. Jo! Get a branch! Jo obeys quickly, blindly, using the incredible strength that is available to people in times of crises - Jo drags a large branch over to Laurie, who stretches it over to Amy: Grab on! She does, and Laurie and Jo both lie flat on their stomachs so as not to disturb the ice, as they pull together. Jo is terrified but keeping herself together to get Amy to safety. The effort makes her own hands bleed. She and Laurie give one last pull and Amy is back on firm ground. Tears are streaming down Jo’s face as she strips off all her warm clothes and bundles them around Amy. My sister, my sister, dear God thank you for my sweet sister. 56. . . ’ . . 1862. Amy is asleep, covered in blankets. Jo is slumped down on the floor beside her, not even feeling herself worthy of a chair. Marmee adjusts Amy’s blanket, and then looking at Jo, decides to take a seat beside her, on the floor: She’s asleep. If she had died it would’ve been my fault. (cheerfully) She will be fine, the doctor said he didn’t even think she’d catch cold. What is wrong with me? ’ve made so many resolutions and written sad notes and cried over my sins but it doesn’t seem to help. When get in a passion get so savage, could hurt anyone and enjoy it. You remind me of myself. But you’re never angry. (honestly) ’m angry nearly every day of my life. You are? ’m not patient by nature, but with nearly forty years of effort have learned to not let it get the better of me. (resolutely) ’ll do the same, then. Marmee touches her daughters face. 57. hope you’ll do a great deal better than me. There are some natures too noble to curb, too lofty to bend. The two women sit beside each other as Amy sleeps. Jo puts her head on Marmee’s shoulder. . . ’ . . 1869. Jo, sitting by the bed, watches over Beth as she did for Amy. She attempts to write while Beth sleeps. She keeps starting, crossing things out. She is divinely dissatisfied. She gives up and picks up one of Amy’s letters. As she’s reading, Beth opens her eyes and sees Jo sitting there. Jo. Oh, Beth! My /love! /You didn’t need to come... never should’ve left. Do you need anything? Here take some water. It’s so good to see your face. We’re going to the sea to get you strong and /well. /The sea! want you dancing by the time Amy gets back. (worried) She’s not cutting her trip short, /is she? No, no... Good. Is there any news? What does she say? She writes that Laurie is there... ’m glad he’s with her, he won’t respond to any of my letters. 58. Do you miss him? (tearing up) miss everything. know. Jo bows her head on Beth’s bed. . . . . 1862. Meg is saying goodbye to everyone as she sets off for her adventure to visit Annie Moffat. Mr. Brooke is carrying her baggage, Hannah and the sisters and Marmee are helping with odds and ends, Laurie is “boxing” with Jo, and Mr. Laurence is there in his proper, “over-seeing-things” kind of way. ! ! Coming! (to Laurie) You take the other carriage and surprise her - make sure she doesn’t fall in love! Yes, Captain /Jo! (to her Mother) /It was so kind of Annie to invite me. Thank you for letting me go, Marmee. Just be who you are, my sweet Meg. (handing her a necklace) It was mine when was your age. Oh mother! Thank you! ’ve never understood saving jewelry until marriage - pretty things should be enjoyed. 59. (to Laurie, while kneeling and removing a ring from her finger) Yes, pretty things should be enjoyed. Jo places the ring in Laurie’s hand. (pouting) wish could go to the debutante ball. . (aside to Marmee) Do you think this is a good idea, her going away like this? Girls have to go into the world and make up their own minds about things. (to Meg) Don’t forget about us. won’t Jo, it’s only a week! (handing a pair of shoes to Marmee) She needs to have some decent shoes. Thank you again for the carriage, Mr. Laurence. don’t know how to repay you. . Nonsense! Although, there is one thing - Anything! For a second, Mr. Laurence’s eyes flick to Beth - but then he directs his comments to Marmee. 60. . It occurred to me today that my daughter’s piano suffers from want of use. Does /it? /Shhhhh! . Wouldn't one of your girls like to run over, and practice on it now and then, just to keep it in tune? If they don't care to come, why, never mind. (bursting out) Oh sir, they do care, very very much! . (gently) Are you the musical girl? love it dearly, and 'll come, if you are quite sure nobody will hear me, and be disturbed. . Not a soul, my dear. (to the driver) Drive on, and keep her safe! Meg is pulled away by a carriage, and waves goodbye to everyone, they run down the road after her. . ’ . . . 1862. Meg arrives at a very grand, beautiful house, and suddenly feels quite self-conscious in her clothes. /. . . 1862. Mr. Laurence watches from an upper window as a very timid Beth tries to walk bravely across the lawn. She stops, and turns back and walks towards her house, and then turns around again, finally making it all the way into the Laurence house. . ’ . . 1862. All the other girls are in their fabulous dresses, parading up the grand staircase. Meg trails in her plain dress. 61. Now what dress will you wear tonight, Meg? (ashamed, but hiding it) will wear this one. That one? Can’t you send home for another? haven’t got another. Only the one? Oh, that’s so /funny. (jumping in) /Not at all. There’s no need of sending home, Daisy - ’m going to call you Daisy now - ’ve got a sweet pink dress laid away, and you will wear it to please me, won’t you, Daisy? If it’s alright. Of course! . . . 1862. Beth enters the big house and makes her way to the conservatory, looking at the piano with love. . ’ . . . 1862. All the young men in their tuxedos wait for the young women to descend down the grand staircase - their parents watch proudly. The young ladies walk down the stairs like fancy Easter Eggs, Meg the most beautiful of all. She’s a triumph. . ’ . . 1862. Meg is done up nearly beyond recognition. She’s powdered and corseted and drinking and flirting. In fact, she’s kind of great at it. 62. Everyone is in love with you, Daisy! You have to keep my dress. can’t keep your dress! Suddenly, Laurie is standing in front of her. Meg starts. Have fun, little Daisy. And Annie retreats with her friends, giggling again. (trying to be normal) Laurie! didn’t know you were going to come! It was supposed to be a surprise. And what a lovely surprise it is. Why are they calling you “Daisy”? It’s their pet name /for me. /Meg is a perfectly good name. It’s just like playing a part, to be Daisy for a little while. What would Jo say? Meg says nothing but looks concerned. (') You wouldn’t actually marry one of these men, would you? might. (re: her champagne) You’ll have a terrible headache tomorrow. 63. It’s a good thing that it’s still tonight, then. (then) Do you like the way look? No don’t. Why /not? / don’t like fuss and feathers. You...you are the rudest boy ever saw! Meg, in her anger and hurt, inelegantly hands him her champagne and accepts a dance with the boy standing nearest. . . . 1862. very nervous Beth sits down and sees the sheet music in front of her. At first she is tentative, trying to play quietly, but soon she plays with abandon. She is on fire. Mr. Laurence, sitting on the stairs, is deeply moved by Beth’s music. Tears stream down his face. . . . 1862. Meg feels faint from the corset and the champagne, and leans her head against a cool windowpane, hot and ashamed. Laurie comes and sits beside her. Please forgive me and come dance. (still hurt) ’m afraid it would be too disagreeable for you. don’t like your dress, but think you are just... splendid. Meg smiles, and Laurie smiles at her. know it’s silly, but please don’t tell Jo. Let me have my fun tonight. ’ll be desperately good for the rest of my life. 64. . . . 1862 The two of them are now dancing, looking young and sincere and terrific. They whirl and spin and laugh and the music plays on as the picture changes to... . . ’ . . . 1869. Meg sits scared and ashamed, and John - Mr. Brooke, intelligent and kind and handsome - examines the two ledger books. He struggles to understand. ’m sorry, John. The silk was the first real expense. (making the best of it) Fifty dollars, while a lot, is not, suppose, too much for a dress, with all the notions that are needed to finish it these days. Well, it’s not exactly even a dress yet... It’s just the fabric. John takes off his glasses, overwhelmed. Oh, see. (working herself up) know you are angry, John. don't mean to waste your money, but can't resist when see Sallie buying all she wants, and pitying me because don't. try to be contented, but it is hard, and, and... (honestly and quietly) 'm tired of being poor. John bows his head, wounded. was afraid of this. do my best, Meg. Instantly regretful, Meg begs forgiveness: 65. Oh, John, my dear, kind, hardworking boy. didn't mean it! It was so wicked, so untrue and ungrateful, how could say it! (sadly) Perhaps you meant it. No! Not a bit! We’ll figure out a way to get you your coat as well, and then won’t we be grand, the two of us? (pats her hand, rises) can’t afford it, my dear. John, but -- need to go to bed. John gets up from the table. (') (pausing, but not turning around) And really am very sorry that you have had to do without so many beautiful things. And that you’re married to someone who can’t give them to you. He leaves, and she is terrified that she’s broken the man she loves so much. . . ’ . . 1869. Amy is looking through her own paintings and sketches and has a disturbed expression on her face. Laurie enters. His lot in life is always to be apologizing to one March sister or another, and he looks truly contrite. Hello Amy! (not turning around) don’t want to see you. 66. Oh, Amy ’m so sorry for how behaved. Please? Forgive me? (still not turning) Have you been drinking /again? /Only a little, and it’s 4pm, you can’t be too hard on me. Someone has to do it. So when do you begin your great work of art, Raphaella? (finally turning) Never. He sees her face, the ashen worry traced on it. What - why? (grim) ’m a failure. Jo is in New York, being a writer, and am a failure. That’s quite a statement to make at twenty. Rome took all the vanity out of me. And Paris made me realize ’d never be a genius. ’m giving up all my foolish artistic hopes. Why should you? You have so much talent and energy. Talent isn’t genius, and no amount of energy can make it so. want to be great, or nothing. won’t be a common-place dauber, so don’t intend to try anymore. Laurie watches her and then says conspiratorially: 67. What women are allowed into the club of geniuses anyway? The Brontes? That’s it? think so. And who always declares genius? Well, men, suppose. They’re cutting down the competition. That’s a very complicated argument to make me feel better. Do you though? Feel better? do think that male or female, ’m a middling talent. Middling talent? Then may ask your last portrait be of me? Amy laughs. All right. Now that you’ve given up all your foolish artistic hopes, what are you going to do with your life? Polish up my other talents and be an ornament to society. 68. Here is where Fred Vaughn comes in, suppose. Don’t make /fun! (laughing) /’m not! You are not engaged, hope? No... But you will be, if he goes down properly on one knee? Most likely, yes. He’s rich, richer than you, even. understand queens of society can’t get on without money. But it does sound odd coming from one of your mother’s girls. ’ve always known that would marry rich. Why should be ashamed of that? There is nothing to be ashamed of, as long as you love him. Well, believe we have some power over who we love, it isn’t something that just happens to a person. think the poets might disagree. Well. ’m not a poet, ’m just a woman. And as a woman have no way to make money, not enough to earn a living and support my family. (') 69. Even if had my own money, which don’t, it would belong to my husband the minute we were married. If we had children they would belong to him not me. They would be his property. So don’t sit there and tell me that marriage isn’t an economic proposition, because it is. It may not be for you but it most certainly is for me. The sound of a carriage approaching, and Amy gives a little start: That will be Fred now. (to Laurie) How do look? Do look all right? Laurie looks at her, really looks at her for the first time. You look beautiful. You are... beautiful. She suddenly blushes, but smiles in thanks. And then runs off to greet Fred. From the top of the staircase, Laurie looks at her and Fred embrace, not sure of what he’s feeling. . . . . 1862. On a perfect spring day, Laurie, playing the host, makes the introductions of the British family to the March women. And he introduces Fred Vaughn, who, of course, we already know as Amy’s potential husband. This is Fred Vaughn, (a handsome young man) and his sister Kate, (a prim looking girl) and of course you know Mr. Brooke - and this is Meg, Amy, Beth and Jo. Jo tips her oversized hat. (British accent) So pleased to meet you. Oh, how elegant. 70. (') (suddenly intense) Remember the name “Amy March.” ’m going to come find you one day in London. Oh, certainly will! . . . 1862. ! ! ! - badminton game between Fred and Amy on one team and Jo and Laurie on the other while Beth cheers on both sides. - Sallie tries to impress Kate and flirt with Fred. - Fred tries to flirt with Jo, who kicks him. - Everyone flies kites. - Jo and Laurie run into the ocean. - Amy settles with a sketchpad, drawing Laurie - this is the picture we will see later (earlier). - Mr. Brooke and Meg are talking and flirting and skipping stones and generally being adorable and have that look of intimacy. - Jo, trying to practice her badminton skills, keeps looking over at Meg, who gazes at Mr. Brooke adoringly. This annoys Jo. Laurie sees her and comes and whispers in her ear. (whispering to Jo) know something you don’t know. (whispering back) Tell me this second! (devilish) Has Meg perhaps mislaid a glove? Jo whips around to look at Laurie. (sharp) Mr. Brooke has it? (Laurie nods) How do you know? 71. Saw it. Where? Pocket. All this time? Yes, isn’t it romantic? No, it’s horrid. thought you’d be pleased. At the idea of anybody coming to take Meg away? No, thank you. You’ll feel better about it when somebody comes to take you away. ’d like to see anyone try it! So would ! More scenes of childhood on the beach play out over the sound of Jo’s voice reading The Mill on the Floss by George Eliot: (..) “We could never have loved the earth so well if we had had no childhood in it, if it were not the earth where the same flowers come up again every spring that we used to gather with our tiny fingers.” . . . . 1869. Beth is wrapped up and looking at the sea and Jo reads George Eliot’s “The Mill On the Floss.” The beach is emptier, darker, colder -- the beach of their adulthood, without the gloss of memory. 72. (') “What novelty is worth that sweet monotony where everything is known and loved because it is known?” (to Beth) How great is that?! (nods, then) love to listen to you read, Jo, but love it even better when you read the stories you’ve written. (self-conscious) don’t have any new stories. Why not? Haven’t written any. You have pencil and paper. Sit here and write me something. Uhh. can’t, don’t think can anymore. Why? It’s just, no one even cares to hear my stories anyway. Write something for me. You’re a writer. Even before anyone knew or paid you. ’m very sick and you must do what say. Jo smiles and then lays back. (') Do what Marmee taught us to do. Do it for someone else. Jo is quiet. Sometimes it’s hard when someone knows you. 73. . ./. ’ . . 1862. Men, and a handful of women, are busily working in a converted warehouse with soldiers, veterans and volunteers. If you’re walking to Vermont, there is Mrs. Sewell in Keene New Hampshire who will give you room and board. You should go home to the girls, can take care of this. need to be here. 've spent my whole life ashamed of my country. No offense meant but you should still be ashamed. know, am. And older man, worn with age and grief, approaches her table. He is almost too shy to talk to her. She sees him, and puts him at ease. Can help you sir? Hello Ma'am. Have you sons in the Army? Yes, ma'am; had four, but two were killed; one is a prisoner, and 'm going to the other, who is very sick in a Washington hospital. You have done a great deal for your country sir. Not a mite more than ought, ma'am. 'd go myself, if was any use; as ain't, give my boys. 74. Marmee fights her tears, busying herself with arranging a charity bundle for him. She notices that he doesn't have a good scarf, so gives him her own, careful that he doesn't see this kindness. As she's doing this, a soldier walks up: Mrs. March? Yes? Telegram from Washington Ma'am. He holds a telegram, the thing Marmee dreads. . . . 1862. Everything is topsy-turvy in the March house, anxious and worried. Hannah and Meg run about getting everything ready, Beth cries but tries not to, Amy packs her mother’s trunk. Is Jo back yet from Aunt March? No, haven’t seen her. (worried) can’t miss the last train... Mr. Laurence and Laurie enter. (hugging Beth) What can do? . (to Marmee) If may be of any more assistance, please tell me. will look in on the girls every day, without fail. Thank you, for everything. . have always admired your husband, and pray for a quick recovery. Meg is nearly running in the hallway when she bumps straight into Mr. Brooke. 75. (looking up) Oh - ’m, ’m sorry. . came to offer myself as escort to your mother. Mr. Laurence has commissions for me in Washington, and it will give me real satisfaction to be of service to her there. Meg spontaneously kisses him on the cheek. Instead of being embarrassed, Meg looks at him with pure gratitude and says: Thank you. Meg runs back into the living room, followed by a stunned Mr. Brooke. While ’m gone, Hannah is in charge - and please remember to check on the Hummel’s, it will be a difficult winter for everyone... At just that moment, the door swings open, and Jo rushes in and places money in her mother’s hand. Will this be enough for the train? Twenty five dollars! That isn’t like Aunt March to be so generous. didn’t go to Aunt March, couldn’t bear to. Where did you get the money? only sold what was my own. Jo removes her hat, and beneath, all of her beautiful long hair is gone - now it’s just a short, blunt crop. Gasps from everyone and exclamations of “What?/How?/Why did you do it?/Jo!” Your hair! 76. Oh Jo, how could /you? /Your one beauty! Now your hair is /off. /You look like a boy. It doesn’t affect the fate of the nation, so don’t wail. (leaning close to Jo) am so proud that you are my daughter. (just to her mother) was crazy to do something for Father. It’ll be good for my vanity, anyway. Jo runs to Laurie, hugging him. They now look like twin boys, and they both ruffle each other’s hair. My girls: love you more than words can say. Be good to each other. Pray for Father’s recovery. will come back as soon as can. The men watch solemnly, more determined than ever to help these women that they care for so deeply. . . . . 1862. Jo sits alone in the hallway, quietly weeping to herself. She tries to make as little noise as possible, but a door opens and Amy walks out - she stoops down to comfort her sister. Oh, Jo. Is it Father? No... It’s my hair. And she sobs and sobs into Amy’s arms. (getting emotional too) would feel the same way. know you would. 77. The two sisters, so different, sit and comfort each other. . . . . . 1869. Laurie lazily lolls on the grass of the beautiful estate, while Amy sketches him. peace has settled over them, they’re friends again. Amy gives him a hard time, playfully: Laurie, when are you going back to your grandfather? Very soon. You’ve said that a dozen times in the past month. Short answers save trouble. He expects you, so why don’t you do it? Natural depravity, suppose. Natural indolence, you mean. ’ll only plague him if go, so might as well stay and plague you a little longer. He jumps up and play fights with her, making her laugh. He captures her, and holds her. (') You can bear it. In fact, think it agrees with you. Amy disentangles herself. She goes back to drawing: What are you doing? (cheeky) Looking at you. 78. (stern) No, mean what do you intend. To do. Oh you mean with life? Yes. ’ve been writing an opera, ’d be the central /figure... /That’s a waste of time. What would you have me do? Go back and work for your grandfather and make something of yourself. She watches him and he watches her. Here. Laurie comes around to look at the sketch - and sees another sketch beside it from years ago, young and full of happiness. (he picks it up, touched) When did you do this one? It was the day at the beach, when met Fred for the first time. The mention of Fred changes the air. When is he coming back? (inexplicably embarrassed) week or two... he has business in London. Laurie gets very intense all of the sudden, words rush out: Don’t marry him. 79. What? Don’t marry him. Why? You know why.... He takes her hand, and she pulls it away. No, Laurie, that’s mean, it’s just mean of you... Why? have been second to Jo my whole life in everything and will not be the person you settle for just because you cannot have her. won’t do it, not when, not when ’ve spent my entire life loving you. . . . . 1862. Amy has her foot in a bucket of plaster, working on making a mold. Meg is reading a letter, smiling to herself. Jo writes a story. Beth finishes a pair of slippers for Mr. Laurence. The room is messy - they’ve let things slide since their mother has been gone. It was never a neat house, but now it definitely isn’t. The inmates are running the asylum. ’m making a mold of my foot for Laurie to remind him have nice feet. Mr. Brooke writes that Father is still very weak, but improving. Mr. Brooke also says Mother is the best nurse a man could have... (annoyed) wish all the letters were from Mother, and not Mr. Brooke. 80. ’m grateful for any letters. Meg, with careful attention, places the letter away and starts working on an errands list. think the deep purple is very fitting for Mr. Laurence, do you agree Amy? (glancing over) Quite. And the design is very cunning. Amy returns to her task. had to thank him somehow for allowing me to play the piano at his house all the time. ’ll go into town for groceries - Jo, can you go look into getting more firewood? You all haven’t been to see the Hummel’s. We should go. Oh Bethy we barely have enough to feed ourselves. Besides, have to finish this story. Marmee said /that we /Marmee said so many things we can’t possibly do them all. But always go by myself and you haven’t been keeping up with your tasks... We work! Don’t worry sweet girl, we’ll find a time. 81. But it’s been weeks. We’ll go soon. ! ’ ! Jo laughs and tries to help her pull her foot out, while Beth’s little face turns stubborn. She doesn’t like this... Fine, ’ll go myself. . . . 1862. Beth gives her slippers, wrapped up, to a servant. . ./ . . 1862. Beth, all alone, with a basket of supplies, makes her way towards the Hummel’s. baby is crying, a panicked, sick cry. /. . . 1862. Beth returns to her home, walking slowly, and feeling strange. Her sisters’ heads bob up and down in the window: (..) Here she comes! Beth walks in, and a letter is placed in her hand: Here’s a letter from the old gentleman. Beth look what they got you -- But Jo clamps a hand over Amy’s mouth - Meg takes Beth’s arm and leads her to where the old piano used to stand, and in its place, a beautiful little piano forte. Look! Open the note! (overwhelmed) Jo... read it, cannot. 82. “Miss Beth March, have had many pairs of slippers in my life, but never had any that suited me so well as yours. And they will always remind me of the gentle giver. like to pay my debts, and hope you will accept this gift. Your grateful friend and humble servant, James Laurence.” (whoops with joy!) ! “Humble servant” /how lovely! (examining) /See the cunning brackets to hold candles, and the nice green silk... They are so absorbed in the piano, that they almost don’t notice that Beth has gotten up and walked straight over to the Laurence’s house. ./. . . ’ . . 1862. Timid Beth walks straight up to the house and then to Mr. Laurence’s office and tries to speak: Sir, wanted to thank you... But words are lost, and she throws her arms around him. He accepts the hug like he’s been waiting for it his whole life. . You remind me so much of my little girl. The piano is yours, should have given it to you long ago. While he’s hugging her, he notices that she’s hot and flushed. . (') My child, you’re burning. The Hummel’s are very sick. . ’ . . 1862. Beth, in her bed, is delirious with fever. doctor looks her over, then consults with the girls and Hannah. 83. She’s resting. . How is she? Is there anything can do? What is it? It’s scarlet fever. What’s “scarlet fever?” (lowering his voice, to Mr. Laurence) visited the Hummel’s, the baby has died. (') Have you all had it before? Meg and have, but Amy hasn’t! She’ll have to be sent away. don’t want to be sent away! ’ll see if Aunt March can /take her. / don’t like Aunt March. It’s for your own good, child. Should we send for Mother? No, we shouldn’t worry her. ’ve never wished for money more than now. We’ll nurse her and she’ll get better. You’ll see. She will. She must. 84. . . . . 1869. Jo reads a story for Beth that she’s written herself, for Beth, finishing the last lines. “The post office in the forest was a capital little institution, and flourished wonderfully, for many things passed through it: poetry and pickles, tragedies, garden seeds and long letters, music and gingerbread, invitations, scoldings, and even puppies.” She puts down the story, looking shyly at Beth, who beams: It’s all about us! It is. love it. It’s just a little story. It’s nothing like what you usually write. You don’t think it’s too... boring? No, it is my favorite one yet. Really? Write me another. Yes ma’am! And keep writing them. will. 85. Even when ’m not here. It is said quickly, almost casually, but it lands like it was meant to. No, don’t say that, don’t say it. have to tell /you. /No you don’t. ’ve had a very long time to think about this, and ’m not afraid. No... It’s like the tide going out. It goes out slowly, but it can’t be stopped. ’ll stop it. ’ve stopped it before. . . ’ . . 1862. Jo, sitting vigil, puts cold towels on Beth’s hot forehead. You will get better. Father will get better. And we’ll all be together soon. We can’t stop God’s will. God hasn’t met my will yet. What Jo wills shall be done. . ’ . . Amy is working very diligently on her French and her painting - Aunt March notices the quiet little girl, and admires her: Amy? Come here. 86. Yes? Come, sit! Amy sits down next to Aunt March. (') (pointing to her finger) If you are very good, one day this ring will belong to you. (marveling) Really? You just keep being a proper young lady and see if it doesn’t. You are your family’s hope now. Beth is sick, Jo is a lost cause, and hear Meg has had her head turned by a penniless tutor. It’ll be up to you to support them all, and your indigent parents in their old age. So you must marry well and save your family. Amy looks serious -- Aunt March releases her. (') (breezy) That’s all wanted to say to you. You can go finish your...little painting. Amy stands up and walks out of the one room in the past, to another room in the present... . . . . . 1869. ...Amy rushes in, excited, to Aunt March taking her tea: Hello Aunt March! That Laurence boy was just here. He was? 87. What a disappointment he’s turned out to be. It must be the Italian in him. Amy sits down without intending to. (thrilled) When will he be back? He’s gone, to London. Why? What do you need to discuss with him? We briefly flash to... country scene in the Paris exurbs. From a distance, we see Fred and Amy walking. Suddenly, Fred drops to one knee, offers Amy his hand, and she drops it.... ...Back to Aunt March. ’ve just told Fred Vaughn that wouldn’t marry him. . . ’ . . 1869. Meg is watching over Beth, who is getting weaker by the day. Jo comes up with a bowl of soup, and touches Meg on the shoulder, relieving her. Meg. Jo cocks her head towards the window, John is standing outside. . . . . 1869. Meg and John are talking, tentative after their quarrel. ’ll come home to help with the children, ’m sorry, ’m just so worried /for Beth. /Stay. asked for leave. ’ll take care of the children. (embracing him) John. 88. And there’s another thing - you should send your fabric to the dressmaker as soon as possible. But /can’t -- /No, don’t say another word, won’t hear it. want you to have that dress. My old coat will be fine for the winter. But /John, it’s -- It’s all settled. No, John, really can’t. sold the fabric to Sallie. You did? Yes. don’t want you to be unhappy. couldn’t be, John Brooke is my husband and am his wife. Meg kisses him, spontaneously, just like years earlier. . . ’ . . 1869. From the window, Jo watches the loving scene - feeling happy for her sister and also a pang of loneliness. Suddenly, a crash - the soup bowl clatters to the floor. Beth’s fever is high and she knocked everything off the bed - Jo flies to her side, feeling her forehead, calling. Hannah! . . ’ . . 1862. Just as in the present, Beth has gotten worse. What do we do? 89. We should send for your mother. . . ’ . . 1869. Jo lays in bed with Beth. . . ’ . . 1862. Marmee enters with Laurie and goes straight to Beth. She’s gone from a sick husband to a sick daughter, but she brings cheerful efficiency to a terrifying situation. You were right to send for me, my girls - but you’ve been very good nurses indeed. It’s mostly been Jo, she’s hardly slept. didn’t know what else to do. Hannah, go make a clear broth and Jo get ice - we need to cool her. Who is with Father? John is staying with him. Meg smiles to herself, which her Mother notices. (looking at the bed) We need to change the linens. Marmee attends to Beth while the girls help her. . . ’ . . 1869. Meg and Jo and Marmee take turns in shifts, making sure that Beth is as comfortable as she can be. When it is Jo’s turn, Beth is very weak, barely able to hold her head up. (whispering to Beth) Don’t go quietly, fight! (') 90. Please fight to the end, be ! Don’t just quietly go away! Jo is sitting watch, and drops off to sleep, her head on the bed, her hand grasping Beth’s. Beth opens her eyes and looks down at Jo and smiles. She closes her eyes again and drifts away. . . ’ . . 1862. Jo jerks suddenly awake - she doesn’t see Beth in the bed. She rises, and with growing panic - screams. Marmee! Marmee! She rushes downstairs to find Beth sitting up with her Mother and Hannah eating. She cries with joy, and kisses Beth’s head. (') Merry Christmas, Beth. . . . . 1862. It is Christmas time again. Amy, standing on a chair, supervises all the decorations. Mr. Laurence and Marmee sit by the fire, and Beth on the couch with her doll. Jo runs around with Hannah setting the table for their feast. At just that moment, Laurie pops his head in and with wild excitement in his eyes, announces: And here’s another Christmas gift for the March family! The door swings open, and it’s Father, supported by Mr. Brooke. Mayhem breaks out - Beth starts crying, Amy falls off a chair, Marmee gasps, Jo drops a dish, and Meg (again) spontaneously kisses Mr. Brooke. All the girls run to him, surrounding him in a hug. (joyfully overwhelmed) My little women. How you’ve grown, and how proud am of you. Each of you. Merry Christmas, my dears. He looks over them to Marmee - who is gazing back at him with love. She wasn’t sure that this moment would come for her, and she can hardly believe she has her family together. He steps out of his daughters’ hug to embrace his wife. 91. (crying out of happiness) Thank god, thank god you’re home. Now can be angry with you in person. He laughs, and brushes her tears away. It is romance, but the real kind. : It is Christmas dinner, with everyone, including the Laurences and Mr. Brooke, gathered around the table - it is the finest day any one of them has ever had, and the joy radiates across the chilly Christmas night. . . ’ . . 1869. Jo jerks awake to find Beth gone - she goes downstairs and sees Marmee there. Jo looks at Marmee, and her mother, for the first time in Jo’s life, breaks. Jo becomes the parent at that moment, comforting her mother, who is trapped in the unimaginable pain of losing a child. . . . 1869. The March family: Mother and Father and Jo, Meg and John with their arms around each other, and Hannah. They have all * gathered to lay their Beth to rest on an impossibly beautiful day. The party walks away, each with their own pain. Jo stays, unable to leave Beth’s side, even in death. Meg makes to go approach her - but John pulls Meg closer. Meg nods - and she is grateful to him, grateful that she married this man who can be there for her. Jo cries, alone. She cannot comprehend how the world keeps spinning when her Beth is gone. We go from the emptiness of the grief to... . ./. . & ’ . . . 1865. ...a beautiful day, full of flowers and sunlight. Outside, Beth and Amy are arranging decorations and laughing. Inside, Meg prepares for her wedding with Jo helping her, placing flowers in her sister’s hair. can’t believe today is my wedding day! 92. (sadly) Me neither. What’s wrong? Nothing. Jo... Jo suddenly kneels before her, wild and desperate: We can leave. We can leave right now. What? can make money: ’ll sell stories, ’ll do anything - cook, clean, work in a factory. can make a life for us. But, Jo.. And you, you should be an actress and have a life on the stage. Let’s run away together. want to get married. ? love him. (angry) You will be bored of him in two years and we will be interesting forever. Just because my dreams are not the same as yours doesn’t mean they’re unimportant. 93. Jo sits back, heartbroken. (') want a family and a home and ’m not scared of working and struggling, but want to do it with John. just hate that you’re leaving me. Oh, Jo, ’m not leaving you. Besides, one day it will be your turn. ’d rather be a free spinster and paddle my own canoe. (hugging her, crying) can’t believe childhood is over. It was going to end one way or another. And what a happy end. . . . . 1865. Meg and Mr. Brooke are married, with Mr. March officiating. . What excessive promises, giving yourself away to get the other. What a thing, what a gift, always given before it is known the cost or the reward. During the simple and emotional ceremony, Amy and Jo catch each others eye - they simultaneously realize that they are the only two left standing. Later, during the picnic reception: - Marmee and Hannah deliver cakes and pastries and food galore. - Laurie dances with Beth, whirling her around, and making her laugh. Jo watches adoringly: the two halves of her heart. - Meg, both bride and host, makes sure everyone is cared for. - Laurie and Jo taste the alcohol and decide it’s terrible. 94. - Meg dances with John, Marmee dances with Mr. Laurence, Jo tries to play the fiddle - then Marmee dances with Father, Jo and Meg dance, John and Amy dance, Hannah dances with Father. The point is, everyone dances with everyone and... - Mr. Laurence offers to dance with Aunt March, but she turns him down. Then Laurie also approaches her. Aunt March feigns even hatred, to cover her epic delight. - There is more eating and dancing until the sun starts to set. As Aunt March moves to make her departure, she speaks to Meg, who stands with John, Marmee and Father March. Well, hope you’re happy. Now that you’ve ruined your life, just like your Mother did by marrying your father. Despite her meanness, the March family is so happy, that they burst out laughing at Aunt March’s rudeness. Dear Sister, you are too kind. And thank you for today’s festivities. You are most welcome. (leaning in to kiss her) Thank you Aunt March. Oh, oh, don’t like to be... ! Oh, ’m sorry. (back at Meg) You’ll be sorry when you’ve tried love in a cottage and found it a failure! (smiling sweetly) It can’t be worse than some people find in big houses. understood your meaning, my dear. 95. Meg and John retreat and laugh and kiss. Nothing can pierce their happiness. (') (to Marmee) don’t miss a . (taking Aunt March’s arm and leading her away) You are not entirely wrong. may not always be right, but am wrong. Amy takes over from Marmee, Aunt March gratefully accepting her hand. (') Thank goodness, here’s the only sane member of the family. really can’t take any more of this. Amy leads her away, and Marmee lets them go. Amy gets Aunt March into a carriage and then lets out a cry of joy. She runs to Marmee, who is now standing with Jo: Marmee! Marmee! Aunt March is /wants me to go with her! How going to Europe /and wonderful! Now know why spent all those hours reading to her! Jo throws her arms around Amy, delighted. No, she... she wanted me to come. As her companion. (stunned) Europe? With you? She wants me to work on my art, and my French, of course. Oh... , that’s wonderful Amy. Marmee takes Jo’s hand, knowing how this hurt her. Jo smiles through her pain for Meg’s day, but it is a true blow. 96. . ’ . . 1865. John and Meg enter their small but lovely newlywed home. He embraces her and kisses her - she’s never been happier. . . . . 1866. Laurie and Jo walk through the woods together, as they’ve done for years. Meg married, Amy off to Europe, now that you’re a graduate, you’ll be off on a long holiday - ’m not good like Beth so ’m angry and restless. You don’t have to stay here. Why? Should we run off and join a pirate ship? He looks at her, and inhales, about to talk. Jo sees his face and immediately knows what is about to happen. (panicking) No, Teddy -- please don’t. It’s no use Jo; we’ve got to have it out.. No, no, /we don’t... ’ve loved you ever since ’ve known you Jo -- couldn’t help it, and you’ve been so good to me -- ’ve tried to show it but you wouldn’t let me; now ’m going to make you hear and give me an answer because can’t go on like this any longer. 97. wanted to save you from this, thought /you’d understand. (not listening to her) /’ve worked hard to please you, and gave up billiards and everything you didn’t like, and waited and never complained for hoped you’d love me, though ’m not half good enough -- Yes, you are, you’re a great deal too good for me, and ’m so grateful to you and so proud of you, don’t see why ... can’t love you as you want me to. You can’t? (helplessly) can’t change the feeling and it would be a lie to say do when don’t. ’m so sorry, Teddy, so desperately sorry, but can’t help it... Laurie backs away from her like she hit him. can’t love any one else. It would be a disaster if we married, we’d be miserable! We both have such quick tempers -- -- If you loved me Jo, would be a perfect saint! can’t - ’ve tried it and failed. Everyone expects it -- Grandpa and your family, Jo say you will and let’s be happy! can’t say “Yes” truly so won’t say it at all. (') 98. You’ll see that ’m right, eventually, and you’ll thank me for it. ’ll be hanged if do! You’ll find some lovely accomplished girl, who will adore you, and make a fine mistress for your fine house. wouldn’t. ’m homely and awkward and odd and you’d be ashamed of me and we would quarrel - we can’t help it even now! - ’d hate elegant society and you’d hate my scribbling and we would be unhappy and wish we hadn’t done it and everything will be horrid. Anything more? Nothing more -- except that... (honest) don’t believe will ever marry. ’m happy as am, and love my liberty too well to be in any hurry to give it up. (shaking his head) You will care for somebody, and you’ll love him tremendously, and live and die for him. know you will, it’s your way, and you will and ’ll watch. Teddy.. He straightens up and walks away. Jo cries and cries. Her heart is breaking, even though she is the one who broke it. . . . . . 1869. Jo is putting away Beth’s things, and arranging her little dolls and toys. Everyone is gone. Meg left by marriage, Amy left by a voyage to Europe, Laurie left because she rejected him and Beth was taken from this life. She places sheet music of Beth’s into a trunk, the hurt in her heart almost unbearable. 99. hope ’m not disturbing your writing... don’t do that anymore. (then) It didn’t save her. They sit beside each other, both missing Beth. You are much too lonely here, Jo. Wouldn’t you like to go back to New York? What about your friend - Friedrich, was that his name? (resigned) ruined our friendship with my temper, just as ruin everything. doubt a sincere friend would be deterred. wish that were true. If were a girl in a book, this would all be so easy, ’d give up the world happily. Laurie is returning, you know. (looking up) He is? There was a letter from Amy, she’s coming home: She was devastated about Beth and Aunt March is very ill - but Laurie will be accompanying them on the journey home. (nodding) That’s good of him. Jo stands and paces, anxiously. 100. What is it? Perhaps... perhaps was too quick in turning him down. Do you love him? If he asked me again, think would say yes... Do you think he’ll ask me again? But do you love him? (tearing up) know that care more to be loved. want to be loved. That is not the same as loving. (crying, trying to explain herself to herself) Women have minds and souls as well as hearts, ambition and talent as well as beauty and ’m sick of being told that love is all a woman is fit for. But... am so lonely. . . . . 1869. Amy, dressed in black, is waiting with all her luggage - she is in mourning. carriage approaches and Laurie gets out. He tentatively walks to Amy. couldn’t let you travel alone with Aunt March being so sick - even if you despise me. Oh, Laurie, don’t despise you. She embraces him, weeping. (') Beth was the best of us. 101. Laurie is quiet, letting her cry. She pulls back. ’m not marrying Fred Vaughn. (carefully) heard... Amy... (rush of words) It was not for you it was for myself. You are under no obligation to say anything or do anything, it was because didn’t love him as should. Laurie studies her face, and we know that he sees her and loves her. (still rambling) You don’t have to say anything, we never need to talk about it, we don’t have to talk about -- Laurie catches her face with his hands, and kisses her. She looks at him and kisses him back. They embrace with both their joy and their grief. This is the way it was meant. It is done. . . . 1869. Jo infused with a new kind of energy, writes to Laurie. We hear snippets of the letter. (..) My dear Teddy, miss you more than can express. . . . 1869. In the forest, Jo finds the mailbox. (..) ... used to think the worst fate was to be a wife, was young and stupid. Now have changed. The worst fate is to live my life without you in it. was wrong to turn you down and to run away to New York. 102. She opens it and places the letter inside, she looks at it, satisfied. She closes the mailbox back up again. . . . . 1867. Jo tries to find her way through the unfamiliar city - she isn’t an expert at it quite yet. She walks too slowly, stares too long, and gets hopelessly lost - but a spark of happiness is growing, she’s figuring out how to be what Aunt March said was impossible - a woman making her own way in the world. She walks up the stairs to the boarding house and as she ascends the stairs and the doors open, we hear: (..) ... ... ... . ./. . . . 1869. Jo, asleep on the couch, is gently shaken awake. She sees: Jo? Wake up! Oh Teddy! My Teddy! Dear Jo, are you glad to see me then? Jo embraces him and looks at him and holds him for too long. Glad, my blessed boy, is too small! Words can’t express it. Laurie breaks their embrace. Oh thank heaven, was worried, well, anyway, wanted a moment with you alone. Yes, of course. Here, come sit. They take a moment, not sure what to do. They aren’t in their youth any longer, they aren’t sure how to relate to each other. (making a joke) How’s Amy? (') 103. Did she bother you all the way from Europe with her preening? (laughs) Yes, but love it. Where is she now? Did she not come straight home? Your mother’s got her down at Meg’s, we stopped there by the way, and there was no getting my wife out of their clutches. ?!?!?! Your... your what? Now ’ve done it! It was meant to be a surprise. What surprise? Well, we were engaged, and we were going to wait... that is to say, now we are man and wife. Jo sits. She’s hit hard. You and... Amy. It all happened very fast. Are you - in love? Yes. (launching in) Jo, want to say one thing, and then we’ll put it away forever. have always loved you; but the love feel for Amy is different - you were right - we would have killed each other. 104. (still in shock) Yes. think it was meant this way. Oh, Teddy. No one ever calls me that but you. What does Amy call you? My Lord. That’s like her... Well, you look deserving of it. Can we - can we still be friends? Though it takes a supreme effort, she says: Of course, my boy, always. At that moment, everyone comes bursting through the door. Mother and Father and Amy and John and Meg and Daisy and Demi - Amy goes straight to Jo. Jo fixes her face and decides she will be the person she wishes she was: Laurie told you? Yes. Amy looks at her expectantly. Jo has a moment of wanting to strike her, the way she did when they were children, but checks herself, and tries to be what Beth would want: Amy, ’m so happy for you. It was meant to be. Amy sighs, her anxiety lifts: 105. Oh, ’m so relieved - couldn’t write because it all happened so quickly and then, really, was worried you’d be angry. (shaking her head) No, no. So you aren’t? Angry? Life is too short to be angry at one’s sisters. (tearing up) really miss her... know. They embrace. Over her shoulder she catches her mother’s eye, who gives her a look of infinite empathy. Then Laurie calls for his wife. Jo straightens up and sees these couples - Mother & Father, John & Meg, Laurie & Amy. It all hits her with a heat and a mass that she was unprepared for. She hastily excuses herself and goes outside. . . . 1869. Weeping, but also in a panic, Jo removes the letter from the mailbox and walks into the woods. . . . 1869. She tears through the woods and finally stands by the river, breathing heavily. For one moment, we believe that she might end her suffering in the most tragic way - she leans towards the river... ...and throws the letter into it, letting it drift away, along with her childhood love. It is over. . . . 1869. Jo trudges back, and is surprised to find Mr. Laurence standing alone, looking at the March’s house. 106. Mr. Laurence? . Jo! They embrace - and then Mr. Laurence tries to explain: . couldn’t bring myself to... The house doesn’t seem right without her and couldn’t go in knowing she wouldn’t be there. He begins crying. Jo takes his arm tenderly. know am not half so good as my sister, but ’ll be a friend to lean on, if you’ll let me. He gratefully accepts her help and they approach the house together, an odd, sweet pair of friends. . . & ’ /. /. 1869. Jo starts awake - she looks around the room: she’s all alone, everyone is truly gone. She lights a candle. She goes to the drawer where she keeps her writing, and pulls out the stack. She feeds a published story into the fire. Then she burns more stories, printed, unpublished, half-finished, she burns them all. It is a potlatch, a total burning down of everything she has made up until this point. She finds one last piece, and is about to give it over to the fire, when she reads on top: “For Beth.” She stops. Jo makes her way up to the attic, and sits in her old writing chair, looking at the story. She takes a fresh sheet of paper and starts writing. She writes all night, and into the next day, piling up page after page. She spreads them out in the attic, like a quilt, building outwards. Candles are lit and re-lit, the sun rises and sets. Marmee brings her some food and then leaves her alone. Jo nods off for a second then keeps writing. She revises, she scratches out, she changes orders. She falls asleep on her blanket of papers. 107. She’s re-connected with her childhood, and out of the depths of despair has found hope and inspiration. Jo finishes and carefully ties up the first few chapters of this experiment and writes a letter to Mr. Dashwood: (read to camera) Dear Mr. Dashwood: Enclosed are the first few chapters of a piece ’ve only begun working on. It could suit as a story for young people, but think it is probably quite boring. However, ’m sending it to you just in case it has something of value, though doubt it. . ’ . . 1869. The empty rooms of Aunt March’s house -- nothing is left of the deliciously cranky old lady. Furniture is covered over, and the loss is felt in the grand rooms. Amy, Jo and Meg walk around the big empty mansion. thought she hated me. She could still hate you and leave you the house! Jo laughs. What about you and John? No, don’t need a grand estate. Meg looks satisfied, and we know that she is, deeply. Suddenly, Jo lets out a and runs through the house. For heaven’s /sake! /What are you doing? (looking around) should sell it, but ’d love to do something that would really make Aunt March turn in her grave. wouldn’t mind that. 108. /Girls! / nice turning, just a rotation, nothing terrible. What will you do? Jo thinks for half a second, but she already knows: ’d like to open a school. We never had a proper school, and now there are women’s colleges opening - there should be a school. For Daisy. And what will Demi do? ’ll open a school for boys and girls, both. Amy takes her sister’s arm on one side, while Meg is on the other side. They walk and talk confidentially. What about writing? (Jo turns bright red) What /about it? What are you working on? started something... but don’t think it’s very good. Everyone likes what you write. (pointedly) No, they don’t. do. It’s just about our little life. 109. So? Who will be interested in a story of domestic struggles and joys? It doesn’t have any real importance. Maybe we don’t see those things as important because people don’t write about them. No, writing doesn’t confer importance, it reflects it. ’m not sure. Perhaps writing will make them more important. (looking at her, amused) When did you become so wise? always have been, you were just too busy noticing my faults. Which weren’t there, of course. They lean their heads together and stroll through the house. . . . 1869. Mr. Dashwood sits, reading the pages that Jo gave him. He finishes and then writes to her. . (read to camera) Dear Miss March: have read the chapters you sent, and have to agree that they aren’t very promising. But, please send us more stories of the scandalous variety, if you have any. . . ./ . . 1869. Jo reads the note Mr. Dashwood sent: . (..) Or, shall say, your friend can. My apologies for the joke, couldn’t help it. 110. And she crumples it up. Just then, Marmee breaks her reverie. (..) Jo! Come down! Coming! ’m starving! Jo stashes her writing and clomps down the stairs and heads straight for the table, not even looking around her. She sits down and grabs a piece of bread and takes a big bite. Jo, you might want to wait.. But ’m famished. Jo, dear, you have a guest. don’t know anyone. (..) am so sorry to intrude. Jo hears his voice and bolts up. (she bursts out laughing) It’s you! . . . . . 1867. Jo, with all of her luggage, finds the address and rings the doorbell. Friedrich opens it, he smiles down at this young woman, with his handsome face and merry eyes -- she comes undone before even knowing it. Hello. Hello. ’m Josephine March. Jo. Just then, Mrs. Kirke pushes past him, with her two children. . (to be delivered without stopping for breath, with infinite cheer and anxiety) Jo! Is that you?! Come in, come in! . (') 111. Your mother says that you’re a writer — how wonderful! keep a diary, you know. This is Kitty and Minny. . see you’ve met our professor, he’s a very accomplished man, actually, it’s an interesting group here, lots of intellectuals and Europeans. You know never thought ’d run a boarding house but here am! How is that sweet mother of yours? She always had such great height, never had that, she could reach anything... She leads Jo up through the stairs and Jo takes a quick glance backwards at Friedrich, as if to confirm that the man she saw was real and not an apparition. She finds Friedrich looking back up at her. She turns away again. . 1869. Jo, hope it is all right, got your address from Mrs. Kirke - Who are you? (to Amy) Who is he? (backing away) ’m so sorry to intrude, was close by and thought ’d, but ’ll be going... - Please stay! We have more than enough room. Can someone tell me who he is!? don’t want to be a burden. It’s no burden at all. (still stunned) Yes, of course. Please. 112. (proprietary) ’m Laurie. And who are you? am Friedrich Bhaer. (explaining) We were at the same boarding house together in New York. Oh , he’s handsome. Later: Everyone is talking. Father and Friedrich especially talk philosophy and religion and politics. Father obviously very much likes him. Jo is glowing with happiness. Amy looks from Friedrich to Jo and from Jo to Friedrich. She can see that there is love between them. (to Friedrich) And you intend to stay in New York? No, ’ve been offered a professorship in California - and as have nothing keeping me here, thought might go West. It is new there, and they are less particular about immigrants. Jo has an unconscious sharp intake of breath. No one notices but Amy. Father continues oblivious: Perhaps should go West... You aren’t an immigrant, so perhaps you should stay home. Everyone bursts out laughing. Father laughs at himself goodnaturedly. Oh, ’m going. 113. . . . . 1869. Everyone relaxes after dinner, and Friedrich eyes the piano: This is a beautiful instrument. Which one of you plays? They all fall quiet. It was my sister, Beth. We all play a little. But none so well as her... It is very hard to lose a sister. ’m sorry. Do you play? do, yes. It would make us so happy if you played now, she wouldn’t want the piano to sit silent. don’t wish to offend. Not in the least. He sits down and plays Bach - it is beautiful and elegant. Jo watches him, moved and deeply happy. The sound of his music plays over Friedrich saying his goodbyes and telling Jo, as he stands at the door: Jo, if you ever come to California, would love to see you. don’t know that will, but thank you. 114. (hurting, but accepting) Well, yes... goodbye. Goodbye. It has started to rain, and he puts up his umbrella and trudges into the evening. The door closes. Jo turns back around to find everyone staring at her. What?! Why are you all looking at me like that? What a wonderful man. hope he comes again, he would be a terrific friend for me. (crying out) Oh Father, he wasn’t here for you! No? Jo! You love him! do not! You do too! may be half as smart as you are but can see it so plainly, you love him. have never seen you happier. What else is love? Doesn’t she love him Mr. Laurence? . That’s a good instinct, you love him. Go get him. Laurie prepare the horses. We can catch him before he gets to the train. 115. (standing) ’m coming too. ’m not going! You are. Amy is right. never thought ’d prepare a carriage to help Jo March go after a man, but like it. He’s moving to California! That’s a fiction. He was practically begging for a reason to stay. But it’s raining outside. It doesn’t matter! Put on a better dress. Follow me. Amy has started ascending the stairs. . . (jumping to action) Yes, my love. . . . 1869. It is also raining in New York. Mr. Dashwood is in his cozy apartment, eating dinner with his wife. She tries to start a fight. . You never ask about my mother even when you know ’ve seen her. . assume she’s still alive. 116. . But ask after your mother. . And have no idea why. . You’re willfully missing the point. . That’s true. He hears his daughter’s laughter and talking in the next room. . What have they gotten into now? . have no idea. The girls tumble into the room, speaking over each other. #1 Father are you publishing/ this? #2 /What happens to the Little Women? #3 Tell me you have the rest of the book! Close on Mr. Dashwood as he realizes what he has, what this story could be, this story that he, and the author, both thought was boring... /. ./ . . 1869. Meg, Amy, and Jo are all in the carriage, making top speed through the rain. They arrive at the train station. ! Find him! Jo runs in the rain towards the beautifully lit station and the music swells and the thunder claps and we : . . . . 1870. Jo sits where she originally sat across from Dashwood, but now she is more grown up, more together, more herself - Frankly, don’t see why she didn’t marry the neighbor. 117. Because the neighbor married her sister! Right, of course. So, who does she marry? No one. She doesn’t marry either of them. No. No, no, no, that won’t work at all. She says the whole book that she doesn’t want to marry. ! Girls want to see women . Not . It isn’t the right ending. The right ending is the one that sells. Jo thinks. Dashwood pounces. (') If you end your delightful book with your heroine a spinster, no one will buy it. It won’t be worth printing. Jo shifts. She considers. suppose marriage has always been an economic proposition. Even in fiction. It’s romance! It’s mercenary. Just end it that way, will you? 118. Fine. . . . . . 1869. Jo runs from the carriage, out into the rain and into the crowd in front of the train station, looking for Friedrich. He’s not there, every face isn’t his. Couple after couple stands under umbrellas. She runs into the station, and then turns around to go back out -- has she missed him? Just then: Jo! Jo sees Friedrich, also standing under an umbrella, but alone. She runs towards him. She feels her emotions rising, she starts to cry, despite herself. (') Jo, why are you crying? Because -- because you are going away. would never leave if you wished me to stay. wish you would stay. But, but have nothing to give you but my full heart and these empty hands. (she puts her hands in his, and steps under the umbrella) They aren’t empty now. They kiss one of those epic perfect kisses. The train arrives, and he doesn’t get on it. . . . . . . 1870. Back to negotiations. 119. (..) love it. It’s so romantic. “Your hands aren’t empty now.” It makes me emotional. He gets a little teary. Thanks. We can call the chapter “Under the Umbrella.” (has to admit) It’s good. Perfect! Now there is the question of the contract... ’m prepared to give you 5% of the royalties. So get 5% of the profit? 5% of the net profits. After recoup. What about a payment, upfront? (shaking his head) ’m taking the risk in printing this book. Yes, but, but it’s my book. If it works, then we’ll both make money. If not, then won’t go under. So get nothing? If it fails? No, ’ll give you $500 dollars right now to buy out the copyright. 120. The copyright? It’s the right for re-printing, that sort of thing, sequels, the characters for other stories. Might that be worth something? Well, again, only if it’s a success. see. It seems like something would want to own. Doesn’t your family need the money more immediately? They do, which is why wanted upfront payment. ’ll only pay for the copyright. An intense moment between them. Her book hangs in the balance. She leans forward, resolute. You keep your $500, and ’ll keep the copyright, thank you. Also, want ten percent of royalties. Five point five percent and that is very generous. Nine percent. Six percent -- and that’s it. If ’m going to sell my heroine into marriage for money, might as well get some of it. 121. Six point six percent. Done. And you don’t need to decide about the copyright now. ’ve decided. want to own my own book. We fade down on this scene, and fade up on: (?) ./. . . 1871. Jo is supervising a great number of rambunctious girls and boys of all races and ages. They are finishing lessons for the day, and everyone runs outside at full speed. Jo makes her way down the stairs and is handed a homemade cake by one of the children. She kisses him on the head and continues through what she’s built. Every inch of the school is covered with the students’ work, all of the former stuffiness is gone. She’s in her heaven. . . . 1871.

Tracy sits in her new dorm-room with her roommate, a girl with mousy hair and a hoodie. She watches Tracy unpack, from her bed. Aren’t you coming to convocation? You’re going to that shit? Yeah... isn’t everyone? don’t think anyone is going. Except rapists. What? Why rapists? Or Christians and home-schooled kids. Nobody really goes. think it’s just a candle lighting ceremony. (pause) How do you already know all this stuff? School hasn’t even started yet. Ruth doesn’t answer. . . Tracy lingers outside the building. Kids are going inside. She hesitates then decides to bag it. . , . Tracy walks aimlessly. . . Tracy gets a personal sized pizza and a bowl of cereal.

Tracy sits in front of a counselor. Um, have trouble with procrastinating. Did you ever think of just getting your work in on time? (hesitates) Yes, have thought of that. have trouble doing it. Maybe you want to try a little harder? , thanks. Harder? ’ll try that. . . Tracy walks alone. . . (..) What comes to mind when you think of the Renaissance? . . Tracy takes notes while a Southern girl talks: 3. think of the Renaissance as being very plush, like a lot of velvet inlaid with jewels, brocades, that kind of thing. Thank you... was actually asking about literature, but that was very nice. Tracy bursts out laughing. . . Tracy is kind of “dressed” for a party. There are a bunch of drunk teenagers around. She sees a Friendly Looking Girl: Is the party at the end of the hall? Did you get an invitation? No... Then no. She’s being a bitch. Yes, it’s down the hall. The Friendly Looking Girl hits the Other Girl and they run away, laughing. Tracy leaves the way she came. . /. . Tracy sits on steps. She’s on the phone with her Mom. could be anywhere. It doesn’t even feel like New York. And by trying to participate ’m somehow fitting in even less. Her Mom moves through the kitchen, cleaning, putting things away. Aren’t you meeting friends in classes? 4. Mom, nobody meets friends in classes. Oh, okay. didn’t know. You know the feeling of being at a party where you don’t know anybody? It’s like that the whole time. That sounds uncomfortable. And can’t go to bars. Don’t go to bars. Oh, did you get my email with the reading - do you like it? liked it. think there is a darker element to what Shakespeare was saying but liked it. Good. Your brother is going to be playing guitar with you while you do it - is that okay? like David’s guitar playing. (happily) He’s gotten good, right? ’m so excited! It’s Thanksgiving weekend so we’ll have a built-in rehearsal dinner on Thursday at the house. It’ll be the first time the two families are all in the same room. Randy, Jim’s sister -- Right. She’s going to make a fig and there’s a fish...and it’s on cracker. That’s one thing. 5. Mmm. We’re going to move all the furniture out of the living room and we changed the lyrics to Finiculi Finicula. We did the same thing at Izzy’s 60th but Izzy won’t be there so it’ll feel fresh. (exhaling, playful) Oh, Trace... (playful back) Oh, Stevie. You know, was very unhappy for a very long time. But ’m so glad your Dad and stayed together until you and your brother were out of school. was out of school. You broke up when was a junior in high school. On your way out of the home... love you Mom, don’t be worried. know, honey. So after you do that, Brooke will read a poem she’s written. don’t think her brother is doing anything - which hurts my feelings, but ’m trying to be okay with it. (has an idea) You should call Brooke. She’s in New York, you know. ’m so bad at calling people don’t know. hear she’s fun. 6. She’s like thirty living in New York with a life, she doesn’t need to hear from an eighteen year old she’s tenuously connected to. ’d be like why do want to hang out with you? She’s going to be your sister, that doesn’t sound tenuous to me. And you have plenty to talk about - you’re both doing readings at our wedding. Aces. You aren’t sarcastic don’t pretend to be. Okay. . . We hear a student, Nicolette, making a point: Nothing is higher than the law. That’s the whole point - Antigone thinks she’s above the law but she’s not - like a celebrity in a car crash or something. Tracy is asleep at the seminar table. Her head hangs heavily to one side. Psst. Hey. Tracy’s head jerks up and she opens her sleepy eyes. boy, Tony leans over from two chairs away. You were asleep. (wiping drool from her chin) Oh...thanks. 7. Tracy sits up straighter. She tries to focus on the discussion. Her eyes fall heavy and shut. She’s asleep again. . . Tony carries a briefcase. Tracy, deciding to make her fate better, walks up to him. That was really nice of you... waking me up. (smiling) It takes a lot of moxie to fall asleep in a twelve person class. Thanks. like moxie. get it. It’s like ’m so grateful to be here, but why are my parents taking out loans for me to listen to that 18-year-old asshole talk? Tracy laughs. Loans everywhere. was going go get frozen yogurt, want to come? Yes but... well, have to get somewhere by five. Where? Um, it’s embarrassing. What is it? ’m submitting a story to the Mobius Literary Society. have to print it. 8. () They only take hard copies which is a kind of pretension can get behind. ! already gave mine! Do you know how you find out if you’re in it? They said they’d post a list - No. The only people who check the list are people who didn’t get in - they come wake us up at night in our rooms and put pie in our face and then bring us out into the quad and make us sing and stuff. (smiling at the thought) Yeah. . . Tracy walks down to a door with Mobius on the glass. There’s a box outside with Submissions written underneath it. guy in a sweater vest sitting cross legged on the ground playing jacks stares at her. She fishes into her messenger bag and puts a story in the box. She hurries away. . ’ . Tracy lies awake in bed. We hear yelling in the hallway outside her door. Footsteps come close to her door. shadow underneath. She tenses in great anticipation. The footsteps and chatter continue down the hall. Tracy gets up and opens her door. . . The hall is empty. Bits of pie and crust on the floor. Another door opens at the end of the hall. Tiny Girl looks out. She and Tracy meet eyes. . The Tiny Girl retreats into her room. Tracy does the same. 9. (') . ’ . Tony sits on his bed and Tracy sits on the floor. They both drink screwdrivers. They’re self-elected douche bags. know, but wanted to be one of them. could die then. Yeah, me too. Both wanted to be in and could also then die. heard they serve wine and cheese and they all carry breifcases. know, when had my tour here, the guide was one of them and that’s why wanted to come here. heard the pie stuff all night. They got the guy next door. He doesn’t even look like a writer. Tony indicates a breifcase from the floor. Tracy sees this. ’m so sorry. Do you want to trade stories? Sure. They both silently read each other’s stories. They steal glances at one another. liked it! 10. Thanks - liked yours too. So do you want notes? Oh, are we - sure... Okay, thought the middle part sounded really fake. Okay. It’s just my impression. ’ll work on that. Do you have any notes for me? Um... no. Great. (thinks for a second) have a car. . . Tracy and Tony drive in the car. Let’s go to the beach. don’t want to leave Manhattan. Oh, why are we in your car then? . , . Tracy and Tony try to burn his briefcase but it won’t catch fire. They chuck it in the water. They smoke a joint and sit on the roof of a car. 11. We look like we’re in a song. . . Tracy raises her hand. think the way Aristotle writes about ethics and morality is much closer to how most people think about it. Less like math, more like a story. . . Tracy, feeling better about herself, cleans the room and talks to her roommate. think we should set up a recycling system for our trash. lot of what we’re throwing out can be recycled. She trips over something on the floor but recovers quickly. And Ruth, think that fan can go in the closet now, it’s 60 degrees out-- . . Tracy is filing with some exuberance. You seem happy today. love filing! It’s satisfying. . . Tracy is running to get somewhere. (..) Slow down, ! Tracy hits the breaks. It’s Tony. She laughs. But he’s holding Nicolette’s hand (She’s the girl from their class). Hey. 12. Hey. Hey. . ’ . Tracy sits in a booth by herself eating mozzarella sticks. She looks at her phone. Makes a call. Her mother’s voice mail. She hangs up. She scrolls to: She quickly presses that name... You’ve reached Brooke Cardinas. Leave your name and number and will get back to you at my earliest convenience. Tracy hangs up on the beep. She dips a mozzarella stick in the red sauce and shoves it into her mouth. Her phone rings. She’s startled. Hello? Hi, this Brooke Cardinas. just got a missed call from this number. Oh...sorry. Hi... this is Tracy Fishko, um, my mom is marrying your dad? You’re reading the sonnet. Right! We’re doing Thanksgiving and then wedding together... Um, go to college in the city. My mom said should call you. Have you eaten? Do you want to hang out? 13. (looks at her nearfinished plate) No, haven’t. . Well, do you know where Times Square is? . . Tracy crosses the crowded street. Brooke is at the top of the steps. She attempts to walk elegantly down the steps. It’s an entrance. (awkwardly grand) Welcome to the Great White Way. She still hasn’t finished walking the steps. It takes a second. Tracy holds a smile. Finally, Brooke is there: Times Square is so crazy. Isn’t it? don’t know anyone who lives here. Yours truly. got off the bus from Jersey thought this was the cool place to live. It’s mother fucking Times Square. . . Brooke lights a cigarette, takes a long drag, passes it to Tracy. Why do you live in New York again? College - go to Barnard - it’s all women uptown - well, “historically” and kind of actually. But there are boys in my classes and stuff. From Columbia. 14. You gay? No. The Columbia girls do their best to make us feel inferior. Which it’s like “ already do.” That’s stupid. Don’t feel inferior. You’re right, that is stupid. It’s the best someone has made her feel in a long time or maybe ever. . . Brooke, wearing an orange sticker on her suede jacket, affixes an identical sticker to Tracy’s shirt. didn’t go to college. Oh. . ’m an autodidact. Do you know what that means? Yes. That word is one of the things self-taught myself. : Brooke is pulled up onstage to sing, she tries to act like she doesn’t want to and then does it. When she dances while she sings it’s a person who is pretending to be free. . . Brooke, Tracy and members of the band enter one of those secret bars, through the back of a pizza shop. . . Tracy drinks a fancy cocktail. 15. It has mint! : Brooke and Tracy dance with the guys. (dancing) What’s going on at college? (also dancing) don’t know, everyone’s really excited about the frozen yogurt machine in the student center. watched my mother die. What? was with my mother while she died. don’t know any dead people. That’s cool about the frozen yogurt machine. Everyone love dies. . . Brooke and Tracy enter some party in Williamsburg. The hostess hugs Brooke. heard you’re opening a restaurant!? ?! . . Brooke and Tracy are in a closet - Brooke is going through it while Tracy watches her. This bitch stole my favorite pants - they’re in here somewhere - she thinks don’t know but know everything. They’re red. 16. (vaguely) ’ll look here. Tracy starts going through the closet. People are always taking my shit. My ex-friend and nemesis, Mamie- Claire, stole my ideas my fiance. Shit. She took this -shirt idea that had, started a company fucking sold it to . Crew so there is that. She’s one of those people who doesn’t have any good ideas for her own life so she just steals all of mine. And then she stole my cats. What were the -shirts? Just really hard looking flowers. Oh my God! bought one of those Tshirts! Yeah, flowers with like skulls and shit. Daggers. That’s a great one. My fiance, Dylan, was super sexy. And so rich. But wasn’t going to marry him. So...wait, you broke up with Dylan? thought she stole him? And never looked back. He cried so hard. Like, whiney. 17. She does an impression: “Where are you going?” (back to herself) was being real, but Mamie-Claire then goes and marries him. They live in Greenwich, Connecticut in some big gross house. Do you know that place? Yeah, Greenwich, grossville. Right? Living off of his riches and my -shirt idea. (instant disciple) hate them. actually pity them. They have no more dreams. Tracy holds up a pair of red pants, triumphant. These?! want to you! She grabs the pants, stuffs them in her purse and then gets out of the closet. . . Brooke makes out with Nate, the singer. Tracy is trying not to watch. Another band member takes a picture on his iPhone. Must we all document ourselves all the time? ?! . . Tracy and Brooke eat pierogis in the mostly empty diner. Is he your boyfriend? The bassist? 18. Nate? No! My beau, Stavros, is in Greece right now. Betting against the country or something gross. Don’t tell anyone that. (dead serious) won’t. ’m good at keeping secrets. You’ll learn that about me. He’s one of those people hate except ’m in love with him. ’ve been to a Greek Orthodox Easter and could totally see myself getting married in that kind of church. She knocks her head for wood. You got a honey? Nah, there’s this one guy, we got rejected together...but he’s got a girlfriend. They all have girlfriends. Actually think he met me and then he got a girlfriend. (pause) This summer, at my job, one guy just sucked on my boobs all night. (thinking aloud) My restaurant should do a pierogi. Fusion pierogi. You like yours? (nods, stuffing a pierogi in her mouth) This is my second dinner. Brooke takes out her phone and types something. (putting her phone back) Just a quick tweet on Twitter. 19. () am into social media. You have to market yourself. If you don’t know what you’re selling, no one will know how to buy it. What are you selling? So many things. don’t tweet all of it. Like here are two ideas that are not on the internet. If did a cabaret, it would be called “High Standards” and ’d sing all the standards. Would you sing them in a higher pitch? No, it wouldn’t be about - it’s about principles, those kinds of high standards - like one of those “string of pearls that’s why ’m a single gal” kind of show. That’s clever. The second idea is a television show, which ’ve read is the new novel, about a woman who is a government worker by day and a selfinvented super hero by night, but like the essence of . It’ll be it’s own mythology. think maybe it’ll be called Mistress America. That sounds like she’s America’s girl on the side. Hey, don’t know, okay, ’m not positive, these are just some ideas. Me too! ’m sorry, don’t know anything, was just throwing something out there. 20. (') They both laugh. (an idea) We need a sleep-over party. . ’ . Books piled on the floor. Lots of drawings pinned to the wall. One framed piece of real art. This apartment is technically zoned commercial but that’s fake. It’s so stylish. Fuck, know, freelance as an interior decorator. You know the Bowery Hotel? Oh my God, yeah. Well, if you walk about a block south. There’s a laser hair removal center that’s very hip. did the waiting room. Cool. know. ’m leaving here in January anyway, moving to the East side if you can believe it. That’s where Stavros lives. ’m going to redo his place too. Brooke flops on her bed. Tracy lies on the couch. want to write short stories. Oh, me too! Not short stories, though. 21. But got rejected by the Lit Society. ’m so suggestible, like because got rejected think can’t be a writer. Why don’t you make your own Lit Society? wish. Mobius is a big deal at school. You’ve got other stories. (smiling) Maybe ’ll write something else and resubmit. (falling asleep, eyes closed) That was really funny when we were doctors. Yeah, need to cut all the negative people out of my life. just wasn’t brought up that way. Thank you Brooke. You’re welcome Baby Tracy. . ’ . Brooke is on the phone with Stavros: My sweetheart miss you so much - can’t wait for you to see the chairs ’ve picked out - we start renovation Monday! It’s so exciting. ’ve been going there just to sit in the mess love it so much. Tracy wakes up a little with the noise. 22. Right. Did you see the lease it was 400 pages! wish you would just come home already so can suck your dick in our new restaurant! She pads into the kitchen. (to Tracy) Can you start the coffee, please? (looking at the coffee maker) don’t know how... (a little sharply) Yes, you do. Don’t be incompetent. If you spent two seconds with a coffee maker you’d figure it out. You just aren’t trying hard enough. Brooke retreats into the hall, still talking to her boyfriend. Um, where are you going. ? (to the phone) Are you still there? Sorry. Are you... mad at me? (..) ! : Tracy and Brooke drink coffee at her table/desk. We have four investors including me. ’m what you call a principal investor. Stavros is putting in my share - but insisted that it be my assets on the line because want him to know have skin in the game. ’ll pay him back of course once we start making a profit. 23. We never went to restaurants growing up - it wasn’t part of our lives. (immediately offended) That’s a shitty thing to say to me. didn’t mean - know people will come to yours. (trying to contextualize) It’s so weird to think that every restaurant see is the result of some person going “ think want to start a restaurant.” That’s not weird. That’s everything. Tracy starts to write something down in a notebook. Brooke is curious: What are you doing? ’m actually... it’s embarrassing. What? ’m writing down what said. You are noting yourself? Yeah... guess so. ’ve noticed something about myself that would make a good character in a story. Oh yeah? 24. But ’m going to save it in case want to use it in something write. . . The commercial streets have that peculiar weekend morning vibe. Tracy is in her outfit from the night before. Brooke is in full workout clothes. High five, sister. That was an night. Yeah, it was... (blurts it out) The best of my life. (looking at her phone) gotta go. Brooke abruptly hugs her and leaves. Tracy watches her go for one second and then also turns to go. She’s disappointed but she doesn’t know why. . ’ . Tracy enters and goes right to her computer. Tracy is typing very quickly, still in her jacket, her bag still on her shoulder. She hesitates, trying to remember something. What did she...say? Talking while she types. Right! “He’s one of those people that hate except ’m in love with him.” (still sleeping) Shut up please. : Brooke Cardinas being typed into a Google search. 25. (..) Meadow DeRiggi lived exactly how a young woman should live who wants to spend her youth well. : Brooke’s Twitter page. Random photos of Brooke. (..) She did everything and nothing and spent time like always mean to - purposefully. on Tracy’s short story. on a Society page photo. on Brooke’s Soul Cycle Teacher bio. ./. . Tracy tries to go to the secret bar, can’t get in. (..) Her beauty was that rare kind that made you want to look more like yourself not like her. ./. . Tracy gets in, but it’s not a good band and there aren’t a lot of people there. (..) She sang with the band and knew everyone and didn't owe anyone anything and couldn't pay up even if she did. . . Tracy sees a blonde in red pants. She brightens. As she gets closer, it’s not Brooke. (..) Being around Meadow was like being in New York City - it made you want to find life, not hide from it. (embarrassed) Sorry. 26. That’s . . . Tony and Nicolette and Tracy sit at a study table. Where were you last night, did you get my texts? You text her? You texted her? About work. went to check out this downtown band at this downtown bar. Two freshmen girls approach. #1 Do you guys know how long you’ll need this table? long time, dude. #2 (sighs) Fine. They leave. Who were you with? Myself. (to Tony) When you said you were checking the scores, were you texting her? Are you sexting? It’s a place my sister showed me. You don’t have a sister. 27. do. Or will. When my mom gets married at Thanksgiving. Why don’t you just text her a picture of your balls. Nicolette! Tracy smooths over some stapled pages from her bag. We see the title: Mistress America. What’s that? It’s a new story wrote. ’m going to resubmit to the Lit Society. Wait, you wrote another one already? You printed it on onion skin? You can read it if you want. Here-- She hands him a copy - he looks at it. (to Nicolette) Tracy writes about fighter pilots. ’m past that stuff now. This one is more autobiographical documentary. . ’d totally give you notes. No, don’t want notes -- but thought about it and actually do have notes for you. Oh...sure. 28. You write like you are imitating someone who is free and wild and it is so because you aren’t at all and it made me uncomfortable and think it would make uncomfortable. And also, stop trying to be funny because you aren’t funny so it just adds to the awkwardness. And it could be 30% shorter, easy. (unsure) . Thanks. Tracy gets up and leaves. Passes the freshmen girls. It’s open, bitches. They don’t need it anymore. . . Tracy returns to the door with Mobius on the glass. The same guy in a sweater vest is whittling a piece of wood. He blows on it as he whittles. Tracy places her story in the Submissions box. She hurries away. . . Brooke is in the front of the classroom, on a bike with a headphone and a bandana. Tracy enters, wearing jeans and a button down. Brooke smiles. (too loudly) Hey Baby Tracy! Brooke indicates a bike with a nod of her head. Tracy shakes her head emphatically: No. Brooke nods, Yes. : Tracy is on a bike sweating an uncomfortable amount. (to her cycling class) ?! (and now in a low voice) know not enough people have told you that you’re amazing. know that that’s true. 29. Everyone loves her, she’s sort of great as a cycling instructor. . . Tracy is really sweaty, still. You did great! feel like just went swimming in my clothes. ’m glad you came. You are?! Shit, have to shower and change, ’m late for an appointment. . . Brooke gets her hair blown out - Tracy sits beside her and looks at Brooke in the mirror. This air conditioning is making me freezing. . . Brooke, in a conservative blouse and suit, pearl earrings, heels, holding a briefcase walks with Tracy in her jeans. She towers over her. (Midnight Cowboy shot.) /. . They stop outside the restaurant. Brooke is suddenly very nervous. She smooths down her blouse, her hair. (pulling down the sides of her skirt) God, ’m packed into this pencil skirt. How do look? You look beautiful. 30. But do look professional? (pause) get really nervous with the investors. ’m usually fine with wealthy people, it’s just when need something from them. No, it’s the opposite - they need you and your restaurant. Stavros usually does this stuff. Maybe shouldn’t do it. ’m not good at it. (sincerely) think you can do anything. Everything. Brooke nods. Right. Kind and fearless. She goes inside. : Tracy watches through the window. Brooke sits amongst three men in suits and another powerful looking woman in a suit. She makes them laugh. : Brooke meets Tracy outside. Brooke looks relieved. It’s amazing how much of business is just stating the same things over and over again. Your body language looked very selfconfident. Thanks. You make me feel really... Smart. Tracy beams. Wanna see it? 31. . , . Brooke shows Tracy the space. During the scene, Brooke is changing out of her “lawyer outfit” into her “tutoring outfit” - skinny jeans, -shirt and Converse. (gesturing) The front part would be like a shop during the day - like a general store or a really nice bodega - candy from Europe - on Monday we start demo and we open in April. She knocks her head for “wood.” She leads Tracy through the back - We’d also have cooking classes. Maybe cut hair. It would be like a community center and restaurant and store all in one. It would be the place that you would, like, to be. wish had something like this when was growing up. Yeah, suburban New Jersey isn’t great with this kind of stuff. Each plate would be different. Let me show you. Can be a waitress here? Brooke opens a box. See! Look at all these plates! (taking in the whole thing) Holy shit you have a lot of plates. started collecting them so long ago - didn’t know why and now have a why! Tracy’s been touching all of them. 32. This is going to be a great restaurant. know! Are you going to cook, too? (shakes her head) ’ll help create the menu and pitch in when needed. ’m not trained, but ’m an enthusiastic home cook. always used to cook with my Mom. That’s the name of the restaurant. Mom’s. Possessive. (trying it out) “Let’s go to Mom’s for dinner.” Yeah, it totally works. (tries again) Can be a waitress here? want the whole deal - want the dead-on-my-feet-wake-up-and-’mforty. ’ve spent my whole life chasing after things and knocking at doors and ’m tired of running towards people. want to be the place that people to. want to make a home for all the knockers and runners - ’m good at that. ’m happy with that. keep the hearth. That’s a word, right? Hearth? . . Brooke is going in to tutor. The final thing she does is put on her fake glasses. Don’t look like a cute smart graduate student? Yeah! 33. tutor junior high because didn’t get high enough scores to do tutoring, but you make way more money doing . So, ’m taking the ’s so can make inroads into that racket. ’ve always been a good test taker. None of this will be necessary when the restaurant is up and running, but ’m good that way, curating my employment. Brooke is rifling through her purse. So, um, should - just wait here or... Oh! thought you had to go back to school. Right. should.... Do you want to stay? mean, if you don’t mind... Yeah, ’d invite you in but Peggy’s Mom just got institutionalized for bi-polar disorder and shit’s pretty real upstairs. Tutoring is like 60% middle school math and 40% know too much about them. That’s okay, then, ’ll just go - Brooke hands her keys, not listening to her. You remember where my apartment is, go there. 34. (thrilled) Seriously? And pick up some pasta, ’ll cook. What kind of-- But Brooke is ringing the bell. . . Tracy excitedly looks at the keys in her hand, smiles. (..) (into answering machine) Mom - hey - are you there? . . . Tracy stands in the pasta aisle, looking at all the different brands of pastas. She picks one up and then another. She’s on the phone. (leaving message) just wanted to know - what kind of pasta would you buy if you wanted to buy a nice pasta? - Like the brand? If you get this can you call me back right away? She hangs ups. : Tracy is on the phone with Tony, scanning the brands. This one is like bowties? Get that? : Tony and Nicolette together in his bed. Nicolette is angry. (on the phone) Do they have regular spaghetti? Is that pasta the same way as the others? 35. (to Tony) Is this some sex game? (covering the phone) No! We’re actually talking about pasta. Hello? Yes. (sullen) Why don’t you just put pasta up her pussy? Nicolette! Seriously! : Tracy still in the store. ’ll get that and ’ll get the bowties. And there’s shells-- . . Brooke is sitting with a thirteen year old girl, working on a set of pre-algebra problems. can be anything, any number, that is what’s about . Then why isn’t it just a number. Because doesn’t roll like that, because can’t be pinned down! It can be and we have to figure out what it is - crazy bastard. Peggy giggles and starts writing. Maybe you could spend the night? 36. Oh, honey, ’m sorry. ’m math only. . ’ . Tracy unpacks an enormous amount of pasta onto the counter. (..) remembered looking across the river at the unblinking lights of Manhattan apartments, wondering who lived there. She touches items, looks at things, takes notes. Takes a tiny airplane and puts it in her pocket. Flips through some prep books. (..) was part of it now, on the fifth floor, in a temporary commercial apartment. There was our castle. Our fortress. Yes! This is how imagined it would be: college, New York, my whole entire life. Brooke cooks while Tracy watches her and hands her things. (..) But outside the windows could hear the hot sound of jackhammers taking the city apart. Brooke and Tracy eat spaghetti carbonara. (..) In New York neighborhoods change as quickly as the weather. Or maybe it’s the other way around. . . Tracy and Brooke walk together arm and arm. (..) But couldn’t warn Meadow. By the time noticed it, it was already too late. 37. . . It’s a bar bar, they’re there to get drunk. Or at least Brooke is. Brooke looks at something on her phone. Laughs. Holds it out for Tracy. Nate dropped a gram on Instagram. That means a picture. Tracy smiles but less assuredly. It’s you guys kissing. It’s already got eighty likes. All his other recent pictures have like fifty likes. The extra thirty must be because of me. It looks like a really stylish breathmint ad. know! Bob’s a real shutterbug. He made his own app. (to the bartender) Put it on... (very considered) ...this card. (to the bartender) Did these two drinks earn me another free hot dog? The Bartender nods, hands her a hotdog. (re: the drinks) Drop it in the glass and chug it. ’d love to get into the app business. think my Dad met your Mom on the internet. Yeah, on a free dating website. They didn’t even pay. Gross. But also guess it’s pro forma now? 38. () (Tracy nods) My Dad’s so strange. ’m sure he’s making her convert to Catholicism, right? Yeah! What’s that about? He’s real Catholic now. It’s so boring, but it happened when my mom got sick. She was never that into it. He’s a geologist. know. had never met a geologist before. It’s weird that someone who studies rocks can be really into Jesus. What did your Mom do? She was a special education teacher. That’s so nice. She was really good at it. still don’t like retarded jokes. Wanna see a picture of her? She hands Tracy her phone. Tracy smiles. She doesn’t look like you but she has your expression, you know? woman around Brooke’s age approaches: Hi - (looking up) Hello. 39. (') Hi, don’t know if you remember me, we went to high school together? Anna Wheeler. Oh ! was in the chorus of Anything Goes. Holy ! Yeah! What are you doing in the city? You live here? No, ’m in Tenafly. My fiance and went to go see a show. Which one? Other Desert Cities. Oh, that’s a piece of shit. And the girl who replaced the lead is . (to Tracy) used to run around with her. Well, she was older, is older. We loved it. Let me buy you guys a drink what are you drinking? You know, that’s okay - (gathering herself) just wanted to tell you because never had the courage to do it when was actually in high school - you really hurt my feelings. (laughs) What? 40. You don’t remember? No! What did do? That thing: “yep, bitter”? (still genial) don’t know what the you’re talking about! always liked you. You and your friend Abe - ! Tracy horks her hot dog. You guys used to do this thing where you’d walk up to me and touch my skin and then like taste it and think for a minute and then say “yep, bitter.” And then laugh. Right! We did do that, didn’t we? We were weird. was standing right there, every single time you did it. It was really mean, and just wanted to say - fuck you. Whoa. . The way you treated me really messed me up for a long time. Everyone is an asshole in high school! You made a lot of people feel bad. Not just me. 41. feel sorry for the thirteen year old girl that was you but ’m not sorry for you now. We were seventeen. If was thirteen ’d apologize to you but seeing as both of us are...in our twenties. don’t see the need. just turned thirty. Happy birthday. Thank you. You’re welcome. You’re a bitch. Why?! You’re the one who hung onto a grudge for this fucking long! Do you know didn’t even recognize you? don’t say that to be mean, that’s the way it should be. (tearing up) You are the same. Malevolent. You bitter. That’s probably why it hurt you so much. Because it was true. (now crying) wish all bad things on you. (calling after) don’t on you because don’t ! And neither should you! 42. . . Brooke and Tracy are wandering home. Tracy looks really drunk. Brooke is still furious at the woman. It has turned cold - in the time they were in the bar their coats suddenly became not enough. That’s so dramatic! What a drama queen. (scoffs) can’t believe she lives in fucking Tenafly. What is she rich now? How dare she talk to me that way and be rich? When was in junior high, this girl Tara Podwoski used to pull my hair and call me a cunt hunter. didn’t do what that girl said. just wasn’t brought up that way. should call Abe and see if he remembers. Brooke pulls out her phone. Maybe do it later? (nods, puts the phone away) Yeah. was so popular in high school but didn’t try . People just wanted to be friends with me. didn’t even care about that stuff. When someone told me was popular was like “Really? Weird.” That’s why you were popular. The popular kids never care. cared too much. Like if you want to know all the popular kids’ business, ask an unpopular kid. They always know everything. Because they are the ones who really pay attention. 43. ’m going to shorten that, punch it up, and turn it into a tweet. Tracy throws up. Brooke immediately holds her hair back and comforts her. Oh no! Did feed you too much liquor? ’ll be okay. We should get you a cab. Can ...would it be if slept over again? . . Tracy leans against the door-jam while Brooke tries to open the apartment door. ’m pretty sure college is supposed to be more fun than ’m having. Damn it... ’m kind of attractive. Argh... might be up for another drink. Is that crazy? Fuck ! What? . What’s happening? 44. ’ . She kicks the door and screams. ! : Brooke and Tracy head down a flight of stairs. : Brooke rings a buzzer. handsome African American answers. Nods hello. Hey, Kareem, can we use your fire escape? . . Brooke climbs up to her apartment window in bare-feet. Tracy looks up from below, holding Brooke’s shoes. Shit. thought left this window open. might have closed it. Why?! didn’t want you to get robbed. . ’ . Tracy and Kareem sit on a couch waiting. Outside on the fire escape Brooke is yelling on her phone. Stavros saw a picture of her kissing a musician. (pause) Stavros is her boyfriend. He told the super that Brooke was living in a commercial space. Is your place zoned commercial? Yeah. 45. hope he doesn’t rat on you. They hear louder shouting from the fire escape. The window opens. Brooke steps inside. Her make up is smeared. She’s been crying. He’s pulling out of the restaurant. . ’ . Tracy is on the bed, Brooke is on the floor in a makeshift bed. Tracy’s roommate, Ruth, looks annoyed and impressed. It’s dark. hope Stavros doesn’t rat out Kareem. If don’t have this money...my partners will bail, they’re in because Stavros was in. And they can go after my savings, everything... Rich people will take any excuse not to spend money - you can just see it in their eyes that they don’t really want to share life with you. Rich people always give out bad Halloween candy. The contractors need 20 thousand on Monday. And then there’s the key fee, that’s fifty - and then there are all these industrial refrigerators coming for another fifteen... need whatever that equals by Monday. He was in for 200 thousand. Oh my fucking god. Isn’t there someone else you can ask to invest? already hit up every rich person knew the first time around. This was well thought through, Tracy. 46. don’t know, it’s such a good investment. ’d put money in if had it. (suspicious) Do you secretly have money? No. My mom never worked and think my Dad was always kind of mad at her for that... but my parents divorce was way easier than this. (viciously) That’s because they stopped caring about life just entirely, it’s not the same thing. My Mom died so don’t even fucking start with me about your pain. Ruth pipes up: My uncle died. Shut up, . Brooke sits up. need some answers. (immediately) ’m coming. . . Brooke and Tracy are waiting on a couch in an apartment. ’m going to be worse off now than was before started trying to achieve stuff. know what it is to want things. 47. No, you don’t. You can’t really know what it is to want things until you’re at least thirty. And then with each passing year it gets more because the want is bigger and the possibility is less. Like how each passing year of your life feels faster because it is a smaller portion of your total life. Like that but in reverse. Everything becomes pure want. (..) , Brooke, ’m ready... : Brooke sits in front of a man, 40’s, in his apartment. Tracy is next to Brooke looking at a chart. Spirit says seek out an old friend. Who? Someone who hurt you. Just tell me exactly what to do. Spirit says something about fabric. (suddenly) It’s your friend - Mamie-Claire? The fabric is the -shirts! Brooke shoots Tracy a look. And, see flowers. Hard looking flowers! Please, Tracy. (to the psychic) Mamie-Claire is my enemy. 48. Yes, Spirit says you have unfinished business with this woman. No, no, it’s finished. Tell Spirit it’s finished. What happened with Mamie-Claire? She totally screwed Brooke over. She married her fiance and stole her idea. ! Shut up. (to the Psychic) never looked back. am seeing this, yes. am seeing... trees... You said she lives in Connecticut! There are trees in Connecticut. The Psychic looks at Brooke for affirmation. Well, to be fair, there are trees pretty much everywhere. You have to listen to Spirit! Mamie-Claire can give you the money! Hi-ho Greenwich! (to the Psychic) Really? Can we get confirmation? Is Spirit sure of this? The young one is right. (re: Tracy) She’s not that young. Ten...ten to twelve years younger, we are contemporaries, okay? 49. You must seek out Mamie-Claire. ’m so annoyed with Spirit. The path isn’t against you it’s just the path. Right. don’t want to be petty... just wasn’t brought up that way. She’s my nemesis, but she does owe me. This has been a heavy weight on you. Sometimes you have to go back to go front. Fuck this parade. ’m going to Greenwich. We’re going. You ready for this, squirt? It’s going to get ugly. (smiling) ’m ready. Great. How are we going to get there? . ’ . Brooke sits in the back seat with Nicolette. Tracy looks at her phone and gives directions to Tony in the front. really don’t like to leave Manhattan. (to Tony) You’re going to want to take the Merrit Parkway. 50. ’ll bet Dylan is still in love with me. Marrying Mamie-Claire is like buying a cashmere sweater from Old Navy. Tony looks confused. Even if he’s not, this is a great investment. And don’t forget she still owes you. It’s win win. Because ’m sure he still loves me. (annoyed) ’m not driving you to Connecticut to break up a marriage. should be in my room reading Nichomachean Ethics. Calm down rich boy. ’m not rich. Yes you are you have a car. No, ’m not - my dad is a mechanic. He and my uncle have a body shop. have this car because it was something that he could give me. (to Tracy) Sorry, think offended your boyfriend. He’s not her boyfriend, he’s mine.` (to Nicolette) Why are you here? Because Tracy made Tony drive you. 51. But why did you come? ... had a bad experience with adultery before. My last boyfriend committed adultery while we were together and just don’t like to let my boyfriends get too far. ? Why the fuck does it matter? You are all eighteen! Where is this old-person morality coming from? There is no “cheating” when you’re eighteen. You should all be touching each other all the time. : Tracy zones out. Do you ever get that feeling when you are on a car trip that you never want to get where you’re going. That you never want it to end. Everyone is silent, thinking about it. Nicolette reaches out to playfully touch Tony’s hair. Tony freaks. Nicolette! You ! Nicolette sits back, pissed. (trying to make it up) Sweety, it’s...nice, it’s just ’m driving. . . Tony fills the tank while Nicolette gives him a back rub. Tracy stretches her legs. Brooke comes out of the store eating a Slim Jim. (passing Tracy) You should be with him, not that goth housewife. 52. No, he knew me, he chose her. Only because you let him. You have to chase down the things you want. (shrugs) was just going to let it go. (considering her) Sometimes don’t know if you are a zen master or a sociopath. ’m just normal! (taking the bait) ’ll give him a back rub he won’t soon forget. Brooke gives her a half hug/squeeze, jokingly. You don’t give shit, do you? ’m so glad you’re on my team. Brooke wanders from the car and stretches. Tracy watches. Tracy watches Brooke, bent over, brushing out her hair from the bottom, fixing her makeup. (..) But the very things that had worked so well for Meadow up until then had started turning and fading. She had no other skills, no other way of dealing with the world. In one instant her behaviors turned from charming to borderline hysteric. People could feel her failure coming. She smelled of something rotten. Her youth had died and she was dragging around the decaying carcass. : Entering Greenwich, Connecticut. The houses flying by become bigger and bigger. More elegant. This is the wealthy. (..) had somehow become the pallbearer. 53. ’m trying to find Mamie-Claire’s address. Does she have a different last name? have a visual memory of it. It’s kind of photographic. Oh you’ve been here? Well, kind of stalked them once. was so pissed. . , . They all get out of the car. Brooke squints. Yep, this is it. She starts to walk up to the house. Everyone follows her. Oh we’re all going? Okay, we look crazy, but maybe that’s good. The four of them walk up to the house and ring the doorbell. Wait. man answers, forties. 40’ Can help you? Hi, yes, was wondering - is Mamie- Claire or Dylan in... ’m an old friend. 40’ Wrong house. Oh, which is their house? never come here! live in New York. 40’ ’ll take you there. The 40’s Man leading the way, the four of them troop over to another house, across the big lawn and through some bushes and trees. 54. He walks up to the door, rings the bell. Brooke, Tracy, Tony and Nicolette stand just behind him, out of sight. woman opens the door. It’s Mamie-Claire. - Harold. 40’ What do you think was doing last night? - don’t know Harold, watching kiddie porn? 40’ ! Listening to you and your husband shouting and not sleeping. - So sorry we interfered with your kiddie-porn. 40’ am a . - Obviously! 40’ Next time hear decibel levels like did ’m calling the cops. That is a promise. He stalks off. 40’ (annoyed, to Brooke) This is the house. Brooke jumps out. Hello! - What - what are you doing here? Who are these people? 55. (presenting everyone one by one) Tracy’s Mom is marrying my Dad. Tony drove. Nicolette is jealous. Then a lot of unnecessary hand shaking takes place. Hi, ’m Tracy. - ’m Mamie-Claire. They shake. Nicolette. - Mamie-Claire. They shake. Tony - and wait, no don’t tell me - Mamie-Claire? Mamie-Claire ignores the joke, turns back to Brooke. - thought we weren’t speaking. Right, want to change that... And have something really need to talk to you and Dylan about... - Dylan isn’t here. Where is he? - (hesitates) He volunteers at a retirement community. ’m in the middle of... (hesitates again) It’s a thing we do. It’s like a party. That’s okay. 56. - No... it’s not... (getting flustered, then clarifying firmly) It’s not for you to say okay, it’s for me to say okay. We’ll wait in the car. - No, that’s weird. People wait in cars. - (sighs) You and your... “posse” can hang out in the kitchen. . . Mamie-Claire leads them past pregnant and just-pregnant women who discuss Faulkner’s “The Hamlet. #1 think the way Faulkner uses language is akin to the way the modernist painters were using paint - exploring the reality of words or paint itself - #2 Only Faulkner was interested in how that happens while characters are trying to communicate, not just drawing attention to the constructedness of the novel. (to himself) Holy shit those pregnant women are super-smart. Everyone is impressed. . -’ . Mamie-Claire puts down snacks for the “posse.” - don’t know if you’re hungry, but this is for if you’re hungry. 57. This place is amazing. - Thank you. Brooke frowns, looking around. It’s really fucking nice. - Thank you. Would it be if we sat in on your discussion? - (confused) Yeah, guess. This week’s book is Faulkner’s “The Hamlet.” Followed by a kind of junky biography of Derrida, but it’s fun. Tight. He and Nicolette follow Mamie-Claire back into the living room. Tracy looks at a picture of Mamie-Claire on a boat, Brooke leans down and whispers to her: Apparently, she got recruited by Tufts for crew and went but then did it. mean, that’s the kind of person she is, just sly and shitty. would do that if could. wasn’t good at sports. Yeah, would too, but it wouldn’t be like my . It would just be something did. When does that become the same thing? 58. don’t know! : Brooke and Tracy wait in the kitchen. They’ve eaten all the snacks. They’re bored. Brooke looks at her phone. didn’t know you could change the font setting - hate Helvetica. Mamie-Claire enters and places plates in the sink. Brooke stands immediately. You look amazing. - Why are all these kids with you? They aren’t “kids.” If they’re kids, we are. (piping up, to Mamie- Claire) ’m an associate and her almostsister. really need to talk to you... - Okay, how long do you think you’ll need with me, because - How long will Dylan be “giving back” at the old folks home? ’d also like to talk to him. - We’re both very busy, have an appointment after this... Oh, come on, Mamie-Claire, that’s stupid, you aren’t busy. - Yes! am! 59. (to Tracy) Remember this truth: It’s only people who don’t have jobs and don’t have anything to do that are always fucking . Like what are you ?! - We started a community farm. We have goats. (wandering in) Goats are more sustainable. They’re smaller. Tony behind her. Than what? Cows. #2 (pokes her head into the kitchen) Um, Mamie-Claire? - Excuse me, have to see my guests out. Tony and Nicolette follow Mamie-Claire to the kitchen door: want to say goodbye to Karen. Do you have a crush on Karen now? She’s seven months pregnant! Why do you know that? Nicolette and Tony are looking at a chess set. Pregnant women are leaving. Mamie-Claire is seeing her guests out. 60. (to Mamie-Claire) Mamie-Claire, can me and Nicolette play with your chess set? - (confused by who he even is) Yes. pregnant woman sits by the door with her bag in her lap. Everything , Karen? Yes, ’m just waiting for my husband. He’s late to pick me up. You want to play chess with us? (to Tony, wanting attention) You have to teach me. No, he’ll be here any minute. She checks her phone. Clearly nothing. Mamie-Claire comes back into the kitchen cleaning up. Sorry, got started on the wrong foot there - meant to say, ’ve been missing you as a friend and... - And? She has a very exciting business opportunity for you. And wanted to bring it to you and Dylan as a peace offering. really think you’re going to want to hear about this... 61. - The last time saw you you were hiding in the bushes and then you started incoherently yelling at me and my husband about how we had ruined your life and the time before that you were throwing up at my wedding. Which is why am bringing you this exciting business opportunity! Mamie-Claire goes into the dining room. Tracy nods at her, like “keep going!” They follow Mamie-Claire. would like to offer you a share in a restaurant ’m starting. - Why? Because it is all set up and ready to go and already have the ability to draw a crowd and it’ll just be... perfect. You’ll love it. So will Dylan. There are lots of other investors. But not so many that it would dilute your investment. - So why are you here? Well, there was a slight snafu with one of our people which allowed a very coveted spot to open up, which am offering only to you guys... Mamie-Claire considers. - It’s not really a good time for me to get involved with a business... Why? 62. - We’re trying to have a baby... You’ll never regret it. - Thanks, Karen. It’s just money, you don’t have to do any of the work, you just get the glory and the profit and the satisfaction of being involved with something awesome. - don’t think Dylan would buy into it. We recently lost money purchasing taxi cab medallions. don’t want to overstep my bounds here but think you might be wrong - when is he coming back? - really need to focus on having children - this isn’t part of what need to focus on. No, just... Can just say no? Brooke gets furious. No, you cannot “just say no.” Why not? - don’t need a why. The money means to you! Look at all this shit, this house that patio furniture. You can spare it, you wouldn’t even miss it! And it really would make a profit! - No. You can’t make me. 63. Yes, can because you me. (trying to stop her) Um, Brooke... - (evenly) don’t owe you. For Dylan because that was just skanky but really for the -shirts - you stole my -shirt idea and you know it. - did not steal your idea. It was my idea and you were there when had it. No! That’s so wrong - remember like the minute said “what if this flower was, like, .” And then we started riffing but . - (calmly) No, you didn’t. Brooke screams. You are so annoying when you get calm voice! Brooke storms off into the backyard. Stops short when she sees two cats. Are these my fucking cats?! - They’re mine. paid for their cat surgery so they’re mine. Did my cats die and you didn’t tell me? Are these replacement cats? 64. - No! They are the same goddamn cats! Brooke stares at the cats hard and then stomps outside. Tracy wants to go after her but follows Mamie-Claire into the living room. Tony and Nicolette play chess. The pregnant woman still sits by the door checking her phone periodically. Tony thinks hard before a move. He moves his rook-- If you do that, your knight is vulnerable. What? Oh...thanks. You took your finger off it, you made the move. Mamie-Claire enters. Tracy behind her. “ took my finger off it?” Who am playing here Deep Blue? He looks at Karen for a laugh. Doesn’t get it. - Karen, come inside, have a glass of wine. Oh, no, ’m fine. He’ll be here. (indignant to Mamie- Claire) So you deny it? That you profited from her idea that you stole? - No, don’t deny it. She’s right. The -shirts were her idea. Then why did you just say that?! - like making her mad. It’s so easy. 65. You took her idea. That’s not just, Mamie-Claire. - No, tried to include her. set up a meeting with people and she never showed up. And then she stopped speaking to me when me and Dylan got married so figured could just go do it. So it’s her fault. - No... She is right that stole a lot of her life ideas. really am not as creative as she is. But she never would have used them. She has no follow through. So it’s... no one’s fault. - Obviously. That’s always true. You know the restaurant is going to be really great. She’s following through with that. If she’s allowed to. Tracy leaves to go find Brooke. At the chess table: Check. Wait, what? No it isn’t. (smiling) Check. Tony stands, pretends he’s being rational. don’t want to play anymore. Oh come on! 66. don’t feel like playing right now. You can’t quit right before ’m going to win-- ’m just not in the mood. People can be not in the mood. Mamie-Claire stares at them. - couldn’t be your mother, thank god. What are you, thirty? We’re eighteen. You could. Twelve year olds can have kids. - Fuck you. Mamie-Claire! - Sorry, Karen. . . Brooke, still worked up, marches across the lawn. Her phone vibrates. Hey Dad - what’s up? can’t really talk right now. Brooke... ’ll call you tomorrow, ’m in the middle of something. know you probably don’t care -- -- care about things! 67. But ’m not getting married. Oh, really? No... We called it off last night. It’s for the best. don’t really know her. Yeah. She wasn’t committed to the church, either. think that was all forced. Sure, sure. Are you okay? Yes, just... You’re really not doing it? thought you guys were really symbiotic. Wasn’t it a web algorithm that got you together? She seems amazing. You never even met Stevie. Through you, met her. don’t know, Dad. Come on... Tears run down Brooke’s face. Don’t just bail. That’s what the Cardinases always do, move on to something else. Hang in there. Frankly ’m surprised you’re so invested in this. Believe me, it’s for the best. (wiping her face) have to go. 68. () have a really important business meeting. love you. We can do Thanksgiving at my house if you want - since there won’t be a wedding. Nah, ’ll probably just end up doing something depressing but young. Home is only a bus ride away. Is it? Just kidding, it is. There is a silence between them for a second. So what does this make me and Tracy? Who’s Tracy? Never mind. Oh, oh, right, her daughter - nothing, guess. . -’ . Tracy is looking through an old datebook in the den. She picks up a 1970’s subway token and puts in her pocket. (startles) Hello. Sorry, didn’t mean to sneak. (saucily) Are you stalking me? left my backpack in here. need my migrane pills. 69. (') He goes to his backpack and gets out an pill bottle. He fixes himself a scotch and then downs a pill. Let me have a sip. She takes the glass from him. He looks at her. How much longer do you think we’ll be here? don’t know, however long it takes. After Dylan comes home maybe. What are you really trying to accomplish here? (looking around the room) ’m enjoying this really stylish house. When you live in suburbia you have to really like being in your house. That’s not what - what are you doing with this whole thing? Nicolette appears in the doorway for a second and then retreats, listening. want Brooke to get her restaurant. ’m helping out. Tony goes to his backpack, which was thrown on the couch. Opens it and retrieves the pages she had given him. read your story, by the way. (he holds up the pages) Brooke is the woman in your piece. You’re collecting material. Did you like it? 70. (evasive) That’s not what we’re talking about. Why are you here? (vaguely) You needed a ride. You forced me. Tracy quickly walks over to Tony. How does it feel to be forced? It feels...uncomfortable. Tracy puts her face close to his. She removes his glasses. And how do you feel now? Still uncomfortable. Tracy kisses Tony passionately on the mouth. Nicolette reacts. (pushing her off) That’s not what want! It is what you want, but it makes you feel like a bad person to want it. (wiping his mouth) You’re acting really crazy. don’t like this. He puts the story back into his backpack. Why can’t you say you liked my story? 71. (upset) don’t know! ’m jealous! It’s better than mine! Sheesh! You want other people to do the things that you can’t so you can blame them. You used to be so nice. ’m the same. ’m just the same in another direction now. Tony and Tracy leave. Nicolette enters, goes to Tony’s backpack and takes out the story. - (..) ’ ! . -’ . Dylan, a round annoyed-looking blonde man, is fixing a drink and doing dishes and Mamie Claire is trying to really hug him with her face in his neck. don’t like it when you try to force affection onto me. - ’m just trying to hug you. Do you have to put your face so close to mine? - It’s nice.... You know how upset get when visit the home... - want you to share it with me. Rosella and Lorene may not even be next time ’m there, okay? 72. () Just keep your face a little away while process that. - (pouting) Fine. Dylan looks up -- he clocks Tony, Tracy and Karen, the abandoned Pregnant Woman, at the top of the stairs. Who are all these people?! , why do you never tell me who is in the house? wondered if could have some water. - Of course, Karen. She goes to retrieve a glass. Oh, hi Karen, don’t mean you. (reaching out his hand) Tony, nice to meet you. Beautiful house sir. (confused) Thank you. Have you seen a girl about this high - (demonstrates with his hand) - that’s my girlfriend. No, uh, there’s more of you? Tracy steps in a little: ’m Tracy. (pointing at himself) Dylan. Tracy is a tight name. 73. (') () It’s a name that totally is a name but don’t know anyone actually named Tracy, you know? am actually named Tracy. (..) Tracy-- (turning) Yeah? Brooke enters. Dylan sees Brooke. Brooke. Brooke now notices Dylan. Hey Dylan. They stand apart almost shyly. - Brooke’s here with some kindergartners. (to Brooke) What were you going to say? (smiling at Dylan) In a minute. Has anyone seen Nicolette? Forget about Nicolette for a second. Stop trying to seduce me! Mamie-Claire hands Karen her water. Thanks, got a little parched. think ’m sitting by a heating duct. 74. (') - (shoves a stool in her direction) Stay here. Have a glass of wine. No. Ted really should be here soon. - Karen! Karen sits on the stool. Tony looks distraught. Can have a snack? Stress makes me hungry. Mamie-Claire gestures to the refrigerator. Tony opens the freezer and fridge stands in front of it. Dylan considers Brooke. Mamie-Claire watches. Brooke -- haven’t seen you in a second. know, right? What brings you to the burbs? We were-- - Brooke needs money. No, don’t “need money” - come to you with an opportunity. - told her about the taxi medallions. Let me make you a drink. What’s the opportunity? (coyly) It’s a good one. 75. - We’re having dinner at the Baskins. ’m sorry to say it but you guys will have to leave now. Tony holds up a Chipwich. Can have this? - ! He leaves, eating the Chipwich. Marty and Jiselle can wait. - Didn’t you guys park over at Harold’s? (confused) You guys know Harold? How do you know Harold? - They don’t! She’s an old friend, she can stay over if she wants. We have the room for her and her students. - They’re not her students. It’s much weirder than that. (definitively) ’ll walk you out. Mamie-Claire leaves through the door toward the living room. No one follows. They’re my friends. Always running with a young crowd. She’s starting a restaurant. 76. can’t wait to tell you about it. Mamie-Claire reenters, realizing no one followed. - Dylan, let’s not do this. She already lost her shit once. What’s the restaurant? Dylan starts doing the dishes/loading the dishwasher. - Brooke, this is uncomfortable. Dylan doesn’t want to do this. (to Mamie-Claire) You don’t know what want. know you see me a certain way, but ’m not just some square. saw Nirvana live and this was way before Nevermind. (piping in) You seem really cool to me. DJed at my college radio station, the 2AM slot. We played Mudhoney, Superchunk, Trip Shakespeare, mean... - No one wants to hear about your glory days in college radio, Dylan, . / do./ do. (back to Mamie-Claire) play this part for you. play this guy wearing a fleece, but ’m not just some asshole bankrolling your fitness goals. - ’ve gotten really into triathalons. 77. Brooke teaches cycling. So cool. - No, only like cycling when it’s combined with running and swimming. (to Brooke) Why did you think of us? - Because we “owe” her! Because you’re into cool things. We are! You guys want to smoke some weed? He opens the freezer. have some frozen weed. , where’s that weed Jason gave us? - You’ve just said “weed” like fifteen times. (head in the freezer) ??? Did that kid take my weed!? - ! No one has touched it. It should be next to the Chipwiches. : Tony knocks on the upstairs bathroom door. He’s eating a Chipwich. Are you sick? (..) No, ’m healthy. Don’t shut me out! You know how hard that is for me! 78. (..) You sound like you’re eating something. have a Chipwich for you. (..) (softening) You brought me a Chipwich? can get you another one. ! Nicolette reads the story on the sink counter. (..) It was clear that the thing that Meadow wanted most in the world - the thing that she wanted to define her, to absolve her from the struggle of explaining herself, to give her a place to put her time and talents - her everything - the restaurant. Tony pounds on the door. (..) It was clear that it would never happen. The most surprising thing was that Meadow was actually surprised by it. She could see the whole world with painful accuracy but couldn’t see herself or her fate. (..) Baby, come out! Brooke finds herself standing next to Karen. (..) The most surprising thing was that Meadow was actually surprised by it. 79. () And because was in love with her, decided couldn’t see it either. The conversations overlap. ’m starting a restaurant. Oh...’m an attorney. That’s awesome for you. never went to college. That doesn’t have to be a permanent state. You aren’t an amputee. know that. You can still go to college. (head still in the freezer) We’ll get lifted and you’ll tell us about this venture. Dylan reemerges holding a Chipwich. Do any of you kids know how to make an apple bong? - (nearly apoplectic) Nobody knows how to make an apple bong! Tony comes back: do. (suspicious) Did you take my herb? No. 80. (..) (') ’ll get you an apple. Why don’t we all sit down somewhere comfortable and listen to what Brooke has to say... Yes. You’ll pitch us. What? That’s what you do. If someone wants something. They pitch. Come pitch us on our media stage! Dylan, Tracy, Tony and Brooke all troupe down the hall. Mamie-Claire hurries behind: We just ran Apocalypto on Blu Ray. Stunning. Stunning. ’ve gotten very into vinyl. ’m into compressed MP3’s. Just joking. have a great early Mother Love Bone that would be perfect for this occasion. Records are so warm. Brooke is suddenly yanked out of the line of people, by Mamie- Claire who stands in the dark in the guest bathroom: - (intense whisper) want you to know that really love Dylan. love his blonde hair and his beard. know you only loved him for his money but love him as a person and also love him for his money but not in that order. ’m committed to being a happier person. Do you understand? She releases Brooke back out into the hallway. 81. Dylan, Mamie-Claire, Tony, Karen and Tracy sit on the couch in front of an elevated stage which is usually used to project movies. Brooke stands behind a curtain. Tracy presses a button and the curtain slowly opens. Brooke appears before them. Brooke backs up and kind of gets a little presentational about the whole thing. Umm, well...it’s a restaurant, but also like where you cut hair... (hesitates) Can start over? Of course. We’re old friends. Murmurs of “yes, of course.” Okay, great. She does a weird “rewinding” type action. Everyone stares. was, that was pretend rewind. Like... Then she does it again. (breath) So...it would have big heavy wooden tables and chairs and... Suddenly a projection of the red warning from a appears across Brooke’s body. She hesitates. Dylan pulls the remote control from under his body. Sorry. He shuts off the image. Umm... It would feel like the home everyone wishes they had been raised in. It...it...it...it. 82. Brooke is struggling. Tracy can’t help but pipe in from the couch. No one who comes there will want to take out their cell phones because it won’t feel that way. It would be like taking out your cell phone in the woods - totally wrong. It’s so rude. concur. Yeah. It will always feel like fall inside - even on hot summer nights with all the windows open. Loaves of bread that people tear off pieces. It would be the kind of place where at 2AM the chef and the wait-staff would come out and eat something simple they fixed themselves with the remaining guests and open a bottle of good wine. (standing up) It would be the best of capitalism. What politicians pretend they mean when they say “small business.” We would resist doing too many pieces in the Times and stuff because we’d want it to stay honest. They would want us to expand and open another one and maybe we eventually would but we wouldn’t try to re-create the first one, it would be a totally new thing. And if ever had kids they would walk there after school and do their homework in a corner table. They’d grow up around all these wonderful adults - Chefs and actors who are waiters - it would be a big funny family and they’d never be lonely. 83. This could all be something you guys share in - you’d be their auntie and uncle - part of the life and food. And eventually ’d train someone younger than myself to run the day to day so could go up to Maine with my family in the summers and have the kids dive for lobsters and everyone would be so warm and happy inside knowing that in their life they had participated in something that was only good. Silence. Tracy is kind of emotional. Everyone applauds. Karen is sobbing. Wow. Dylan walks up to Brooke, kissing her on each cheek, pretending to be speechless. (to the group) You know, lived in the City for many years. Before started at Goldman, was teaching at Baruch and lived in an East Village walkup. was the people people make television shows about. (to Tracy) was quite beautiful. He takes Brooke’s hand. Mamie-Claire reacts. Takes his other hand. They are all holding hands. This is very fucking interesting. Really? (re: Tracy and Brooke) So, are you both doing it? No, but we’re sisters and ’m-- Tracy is spiritual guidance and waitress. 84. (thrilled) Really? wasn’t sure you had heard me those times. hear everything. How much do you need? It’s 200 total but calculated we need forty-two point five on Monday. For refrigeration. Forty-two point five stacks, huh? What are stacks? thousand? - thought “stacks” meant a hundred. ’m pretty sure a stack is a thousand. think a dime is a thousand. (cutting to the chase) Nevermind, you’d do that? want to help you. The door bell rings. Karen springs off her stool. That’s Ted! Bye everyone. Bye. (to Brooke) Good luck with your restaurant! 85. She hurries out. - Dylan, this is really something for us to talk about privately. We need fresh drinks. He starts for the kitchen. Brooke follows. (..) Umm, Mamie-Claire! Can you come here please? - Can it wait, Karen? (..) No! Mamie-Claire hesitates, torn between keeping and eye of Dylan and going to Karen, and then runs to Karen. : Harold is at the door. Karen stands there, confused. It’s not Ted. - Harold-- am calling the cops. You were warned. (..) Could the weed be in the garage freezer? - don’t know! (..) Can you check? - (yelling) ’m blowing Harold so he doesn’t call the cops. . ’m probably just going to have to go look at his boat collection. 86. (stepping inside) can’t remember the last time was over here. - don’t think you’ve ever been over here, Harold. No, when you first moved here, came for a stilted barbecue. - That’s when we made an effort. Well, invite me in now. want a house tour. Tony is working on the apple bong with his all-purpose tool, Tracy watches him. You are such a Swiss Army knife kind of guy. have to be a better loser. really love Nicolette. She’s angry about the chess game? Yeah, think so. ’m mostly in touch with my feminine side but then guess not though because don’t understand her right now. Did you... did you want to be with me ever? don’t want to get into this... No, ’m not going to kiss you. Just a question. Tony considers: 87. Yeah, liked you, but love Nicolette and honestly... just never saw you that way. Why? You seemed... need someone can love, not keep up with. (nodding) Sometimes really think ’m just smarter and better than everyone else. Not necessarily with math or science or whether something is east or west but pretty much with everything else. And if could just figure out my look ’d be the most beautiful woman in the world too. Sometimes think ’m a genius and wish could just fast-forward my life to the part where everyone knows it. Tony holds up the completed apple bong. It’s beautiful. Brooke has followed Dylan into the kitchen, he’s fixing a drink. have to say, ’m impressed Brooke. It takes a lot of moxie to start a restaurant. Thanks. You’re doing it, babe. You’re out there, doing something besides amassing and hoarding money. If could figure out how to amass and hoard money, ’d do it. 88. You could have married me or a dozen other guys but you wanted to be your own person. Yeah, no, ’m over that now. Dylan laughs. He moves toward her. She moves in. You’re funny because you don’t know you’re funny. know ’m funny. There’s nothing don’t know about myself. That’s why can’t do therapy. They’re close now. He pushes a strand out of her face and behind her ear. Brooke is going with it. and see a woman in New Haven. Oh...you guys see a therapist? Like a tune up? More like a death watch. She’s totally on my side. She basically thinks Mamie-Claire is holding me back and should just leave her. Your couple’s therapist said that? In so many words. Yeah, we’re done. (sadly) Mamie-Claire said you were trying to have kids. We’ve talked about it but we’ve also talked about breaking up. Oh no, ’m sorry-- 89. No, it’s liberating. feel great. (freaked out) Yay... miss New York, man. miss you. look you up periodically on the internet. You look hot as hell in those party pictures. Brooke takes a step back. Oh...do ? Which party? Sometimes look like have fat arms. He takes another step forward. like fat arms. ’m going to help you. (tearful) Thank you. She hugs him. He holds the hug too long. She has to yank herself free. Here’s what ’m going to do for you. We’ll take my forty-three stacks or dimes and pay back the other investors, whatever they’re in for thus far. You got a space already? lease? Brooke, realizing, nods. We’ll put it up for rent immediately, cool neighborhood? (almost inaudible) Williamsburg. Oh, come on! The coolest. Yeah, we’ll turn it over no problem. 90. () Because let’s face it having a restaurant is like having a kid with a drug problem. It’s...just...it’s really draining. (crushed) You’re giving me money to not start a restaurant? First of all - ’m saving you. If you started the restaurant, you’d be back here in a year asking for five times this. Not if it was successful -- What are the odds? He pushes a hair away from her face. He’s close to her now. You’re as beautiful as ever. Whatever you’re doing it’s working. No. No, it isn’t. Brooke hesitates. Dylan grins. Tracy enters. Did you ever find the pot? Tony just made a beautiful apple bong. We’ll have to, because some celebrating is in order. (putting his arm around Brooke) think we may have reached a deal. (shaking off her disappointment) Yes... Dylan made a proposition. ’m going to give her money immediately. 91. (') Yay! - (..) You’re giving her money? Mamie-Claire enters. Dylan takes his arm off of Brooke. Who was at the door? - Harold. He’s giving himself a tour of the house. Where’s Karen? - don’t fucking know. You’re giving her money??? This is our decision. Not yours. ’m not giving her 200 grand, don’t worry, ’m just bailing her out of her current situation. Tracy looks at Brooke. And then for the whole restaurant? (trying to be brave) No... won’t do the restaurant now. It’s just gotten too crazy. Oh. (to Tracy) You believe in her, don’t you? Tracy nods. Brooke watches her. This is a good result, this is even better than getting the restaurant. Less financial uncertainty. 92. He’s right. think even feel a little relieved. “Mom’s” wasn’t about money. Well, don’t think anyone starts anything with the dream of making money. Do they not? - Why would you give her money? It’s my money. make it. can do what want with it. Just like, you have your -shirt money, you can do what you want with that. - But ... we’re married. This is our life. Brooke looks at Tracy. You know what, appreciate it, Dylan, Mamie-Claire, but ’m not going to take the money. ’ll figure something else out. Why? Brooke looks at Mamie-Claire. just wasn’t brought up that way. Mamie-Claire smiles at her. An unspoken “Thanks.” Tracy comes over to Brooke. What will you do? ’ll figure it out. always do. 93. ’m so impressed by you and worried for you at the same time. She hugs Brooke. ’m so glad you’re my sister. Brooke is about to say something when they . . -’ . Dylan, Mamie-Claire, Brooke and Tracy enter. Nicolette and Tony are arguing. love ! Don’t lie to my face and stab me in the back butter boy! Hey, that’s mean... She sees Tracy. You’re stealing my boyfriend! You’re cuckholding me! She starts hitting Tracy. Harold and Karen enter. You bitch whore! Guys! (to Brooke) She just started attacking her! (walking in) What it about this house? Everyone screams. - Please stop it! Brooke helps Mamie-Claire pull Nicolette off Tracy. 94. (still struggling) She’s stealing my boyfriend! am not! resisted! resisted! Chill the fuck out. Ladies, ladies. (re: her stomach) don’t like shouting around the baby. - (to Karen) Is that a real thing? ’m right here, she’s not stealing anything... It’s just that! There’s also ! The pulls a wrinkled stack of papers out of her pants. What the fuck is that? Or cursing. Tracy knows what it is. ’ll give you a hint: it’s onion skin. on Tracy. Nicolette points at her. (pointing her finger) She’s a and a bad person. 95. (to Brooke) It’s not you... It’s just inspired. You make me want to write. - This is so nerdy. Who wouldn’t want to write a story about Brooke? - (raising her hand) Me. wouldn’t. (to Nicolette) Baby, resisted. (settling in, taking a seat) Can get a drink? #3 Here, have mine. (giving him her wine) They keep handing me alcohol. (to Tracy) You wrote a story about me? (to Brooke) She hates you - she wrote mean things about you. No didn’t! ’d like to read it. If it’s about me. ’d like to, too. - (to Dylan) You don’t read fiction. 96. When it’s about my friends do. (to Brooke) Oh, it’s not really you, but it’s very funny, the character that Nicolette and Tony misconstrued as you is a very funny character. (not thrilled with this) Funny? What does it say? It’s not funny. It’s just...it’s not you. (to Brooke) Do you live in an apartment that’s zoned commercial? Brooke hesitates. Gimme that story. She snatches it out of Nicolette’s hands. : Brooke reads with Mamie-Claire, Karen, Harold and Dylan all reading over her shoulder. Tony and Nicolette also hover in the background, reading here and there. Tracy watches nervously from across the room. Brooke starts to turn the page. Everyone indicates they’re not finished with that page yet. : Brooke turns the final page. She looks at Tracy. She is . It wasn’t meant to be hurtful - didn’t mean to hurt you, Brooke. (shaking with fury) You don’t get to decide what’s hurtful and not hurtful. can only tell you my intention. 97. You wrote this after night with me? ?! guess so, yeah, it felt longer. You think ’m a rotting carcass? That ’m doomed to failure??? No! It’s fiction that’s why it’s fiction... So much of this “fiction” did happen this way. Karen, you’re a lawyer. ’m going to sue you until you have . ’m just writing from my life... No, this isn’t your life! But was there that night. ! was going to have that night anyway, you never were! But did have it though. You joined my life - you needed a place to go and invited you in and then you stole my life. You’re a . . You loved being admired by me, you loved it, you loved having lessons to impart... ’ . Tracy looks for support from Tony and Nicolette. 98. Brooke, you know great plays, right? - how would it have been if Tennessee Williams hadn’t used people he knew, there wouldn’t be any plays, there wouldn’t - ’ . You took something said and made a tweet about it! What about that? That’s different! You were right there! You knew was Twittering, it wasn’t some sneaky shitty thing - do you want me to credit you? Or no ’ll just delete it. That’s not the point ’m asking you to empathize. It’s my least popular tweet anyway! Stop talking about Twitter, it’s so awkward! You are much more of an asshole than you initially appear. agree. (looking again at the story) And...you think haven’t dealt with the pain of my mother’s death? deal with it all the time, talk about it all the time. You talk about it all the time, but you never talk about . You just throw out that she died and that shuts everyone up. 99. () Your tragedy is your armor in which nothing is ever your fault. Brooke looks around, desperately wild eyed, looking for support. ! ! ! Everyone jumps on Tracy, agreeing with Brooke, says she’s a dick. It’s like your whole generation, it’s all pastiche. Mamie-Claire has been writing. She finishes and calmly joins the discussion. - The emotional betrayal can’t speak to - didn’t “betray” her - - But can say that you portray women terribly. And because of that. Mamie-Claire refers to her piece of neatly folded paper. - ’ve prepared some questions ’d like you to think about. Are you fucking kidding me? - And want you to answer these questions, not for our satisfaction, but for your own. (gazing at her paper) One: Do you believe in the women’s right to choose? Yes, what does that - - Excuse me, ’m not done. 100. (') She’s not done, bitch! - Brooke, please. Two: What do you think someone who bombs abortion clinics would think of your story? There isn’t even an abortion in this story! No you just portray women as crazy desperate gold diggers! (to Brooke) You seemed so cool so totally amazing didn’t think it would be possible to hurt you... Of it’s possible, am the sensitive person... - To your own feelings. (wailing) Mamie-Claire! - Sorry, don’t really think that, it’s just something would have said at one time. have to say, what you did to Brooke is f-ed up. Karen, you don’t see my side? No, sweetheart. You don’t have a side you’re just wrong. 101. - You must call the Lit Society and tell them you’re withdrawing your essay-- It’s not an essay, it’s a short story. - This cannot appear in print or online. Karen, will you represent Brooke? ’m a tax attorney, but . - Will you draw up a contract, please? Yes, and in the meantime, ’m going to ask you to rewrite the story and give Brooke the rewritten story. ’ll give you my email and you can me. She could just you. Nic’s right, because we’d already know that you’re getting it... Sure, me. (sympathetically) Technology can be complicated. know! just learned what “case sensitive” meant seriously yesterday. ’m not going to do any of this stuff. You’re my sister and love you but stand by what did. 102. Guess what, bitch? My dad isn’t going to marry your slutty atheist mother so we’re not sisters. We never will be. We’re nothing to each other. Mamie-Claire tucks her folded paper into Tracy’s pocket. - There are ten questions there. All equally important for you to answer. Brooke... But Brooke won’t look at her. . -’ . Tracy sits alone. She smokes from the apple bong. . . Tracy rides on the train. She opens Mamie-Claire’s questions. She reads them to herself. . . Tracy opens the door to her room. Her mom is sitting on the bed. She looks like she’s been crying. Mom? Oh, honey! Ruth signed me in. : Tracy’s Mom is crying. Tracy sits next to her on the bed. The Catholicism thing has been kind of crazy and he kind of -- just saw a side of him that didn’t know before. It’s strange to not really know someone... Oh... 103. ’m sorry, know you liked Brooke. He told me that she worships you, she kept talking about how smart you are, how interesting... Tracy starts crying. Oh, honey, don’t cry, you can still be friends... went -- went through a breakup too. You didn’t tell me you were dating anyone. know. She cries harder. Oh my sweet girl. Do you want to talk about it? No, it’s too late now anyway. Mom rubs Tracy’s back. know this is crappy timing, but need to take a vacation, and got the deposit back for the flowers and Colleen told me to come with her family to the Caribbean over Thanksgiving, and Trace, need it. Yeah, that sounds nice, Stevie. So you’re okay, for Thanksgiving, not coming home? ’m sure your father would love to have you... Oh, didn’t put that together - yes, ’m fine. ’ll be fine. Are you okay? 104. ’m sad. ’m very sad. But ’ll be okay. wish it had worked, even though didn’t really know him. Me too, Baby Tracy. . . Tracy’s sleeping. She looks peaceful. We a door open, footsteps and suddenly a pie is jammed in her face. Tracy screams. And screams. And screams. The members of the Mobius Lit Club all stop in their tracks. The boy in the sweater vest says: You’re in. . . Tracy walks with the Sweater Vest Boy. She holds a briefcase. She sees Tony and Nicolette across the path. They see her and then look away. . . on The Mobius Literary Journal. Tracy opens it up to her story: Mistress America by Tracy Fishko. She reads it again in the magazine. . . Tree lighting ceremony. Tracy walks under the lit trees. . . Tracy waits. . ’ . Tracy sits across from the Psychic. Sometimes worry that ’m a bad person. That ’m one of those people who essentially has no conscience. 105. Spirit says that you need to find your home in yourself. The Psychic suddenly takes her hand: Spirit says that you haven’t dropped into your body yet. If ’m not in my body, where am ? Five feet to the left and unhappy. . . Tracy hurls her briefcase into the water. . . Tracy sits in front of the Advisor. If a person wanted to start their own club, how would a person go about it? Well, think it’s pretty much done for this semester, but you could put in an application for funding for next semester... . ’ . knock on the door. Tony answers it. Hey, can come in? . Tracy sits on the floor. You going home for Thanksgiving? No, going to Baltimore with Nicolette. 106. Oh...nice. Her dad fries a turkey apparently. You? Nah. She hands Tony a couple of pieces of paper. It’s an application. Two. don’t want to join Mobius. ’ve had enough rejection. It’s not for Mobius. quit the briefcase club. You were right, they’re self-appointed douche bags. ’m starting my own zine and ’m not saying you’re in, but am saying ’d be very interested in getting your and Nicolette’s application. Tony stands, he thinks about this for a moment. ’ll fix us some screwdrivers. . : Tracy goes by the restaurant. For Let. Tracy goes to Soul Cycle, a different instructor. Thanksgiving Day parade. Tracy watches the floats alone. . ’ . . Tracy knocks on a door. Kareem, in a tie, answers. Hello. 107. Hi - ’m sorry to bother you on Thanksgiving, but met you once - went through your window? It was in the middle of the night... Yeah... was with Brooke. You’re her sister, right? Well, was going to be. Do you have a number for her? The old one isn’t working... don’t-- Anyway - was going to ask you: do you know where she went? Kareem indicates for Tracy to follow him. She passes through a cozy apartment. The table is set for the holiday. couple of kids run through. Her front door is still bolted shut. They reach the window. Kareem opens it. She’s upstairs. . . Tracy climbs the fire escape. She gets to the top window and looks through the glass. The place is mostly empty save for stacked boxes and suitcases. Brooke walks into the room and places some books into a box. She wears her red pants. Tracy knocks. Brooke looks up and comes to the window. She and Tracy stare at each other through the glass. 108. (through the glass) Hi. Hi. Can come in? : Tracy sits on some boxes watching Brooke move around packing. You’re leaving? In a couple of hours. ’m going to try my luck out west. You’re going today? On Thanksgiving? New York isn’t the New York used to know. There’s too much construction. Maybe is my lady. In qualify as well-read. wanted to say-- know you’re sorry. ’m not really that sorry. You’re not? No. Oh then fuck this. Brooke opens the window again. No, no wait... (pause) looked for you. 109. ’ve been around. Are you ? Like, financially? Yeah. Mamie-Claire gave me what would have been my share of our Tshirt profits. It was just enough to pay off my debts and get out of town. What will you do in ? don’t know. think ’m sick. And don’t know if my ailment has a name - it’s just me sitting and staring at the internet or the television for long periods of time interspersed by trying to not do that and then lying about what ’ve been doing. Then ’ll get so excited about something that the excitement overwhelms me and can’t sleep or do anything - and then just am in love with everything but can’t figure out how to make myself work in the world. think have that too. wish we lived in feudal times when your position in the world couldn’t change. If you were a king or a peasant you had to just be happy with who you were. (pause) But...wait! Brooke looks inside an open box. She finds a piece of paper and hands it to Tracy. : results. 2200. You can tutor ’s now. 110. Well, thought might actually go to college. ’m not an amputee. (confused) Right. filled out a couple of applications. wrote my college essay all about you. (apprehensive) Really? Oh snap! No. It’s about my mom. But had you there. Yeah. Brooke goes into the other room to retrieve more books. (..) let Mamie-Claire and Dylan keep the cats. It’s like, gave them a chance for a better life, better than could have provided for them. The cats went from stolen to given because you changed your mind. (..) Don’t put that in a story. Not because care but because it’s not a very good observation. Tracy sees the Mobius Literary Journal (the one with her story) inside an open box. She’s about to say something, but thinks better of it. Brooke reenters and tosses books into the box. You know what’s funny... ’m not even done with my first semester of college. 111. This won’t even be your big “college story.” think it’ll always be pretty big. Brooke hesitates, emotional for a second. She musses Tracy’s hair like a kid. Well, thanks for stopping by, but have more packing to do before Kareem and break down the front door. It’ll be hard for me not to look at New York and think of you somewhere in it. Brooke shrugs. Yeah. Tracy moves toward the window. She looks back at her friend. Hey Brooke... Brooke turns around. It’s not going to be as great as what my mom and your dad were planning, but... Do you want to have Thanksgiving with me? /. . We watch Brooke and Tracy through the window eating pierogis for Thanksgiving. (..) Meadow had made rich fat women less fat and rich stupid kids less stupid and lame rich men less lame. And she wanted so badly to be on the other side - to be fat and stupid and lame and rich. 112.

Buttercup drops two large buckets near him. Farm Boy. Fill these with water -- (a beat) --please. As you wish. She leaves; his eyes stay on her.

Of course you will. But what if something happens to you? Hear this now: will come for you. But how can you be sure? This is true love. You think this happens every day?

His name is . We are but poor, lost circus performers. Is there a village nearby? There is nothing nearby; not for miles. Then there will be no one to hear you scream- He nods to the giant, Fezzik, who merely reaches over, touches a nerve on Buttercup's neck, and the start of a scream is all she manages --unconsciousness comes that fast. As she starts to fall -- : sailboat is moored. It's dusk now, shadows are long. Inigo, the Spaniard, busies himself getting the boat ready. : The giant Fezzik carries Buttercup, unconscious, on board. Vizzini rips some tiny pieces of fabric from an army jacket and tucks them along the saddle of Buttercup's horse. There is about the entire operation a sense of tremendous skill and precision. What is that you're ripping? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 10. (not stopping or turning) It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder. Who's Guilder? (pointing straight out) The country across the sea. The sworn enemy of Florin. (slaps the horse's rump) Go! The horse takes off. They start for the boat. Once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the Prince suspect the Guilderians have abducted his love. When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed. You never said anything about killing anyone. Vizzini hops onto the boat. 've hired you to help me start a war. That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition. just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl. (whirling on Fezzik) Am going mad or did the word ""think"" escape your lips? You were not hired for your brains, you hippopotamic land mass. agree with Fezzik. : --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 11. : Vizzini, in a fury. (We only thought he was in a fury --now he's really getting mad) Oh. The sot has spoken. What happens to her is not truly your concern -- will kill her -- (louder) And remember this -- never forget this -- : , as Vizzini advances on them. Nothing shows on Inigo's face, but is panicked by Vizzini. (to Inigo) -- when found you, you were so slobbering drunk you couldn't buy brandy -- (now to Fezzik, who retreats as much as he can while Vizzini advances) -- and you -- friendless, brainless, helpless, hopeless -- Do you want me to send you back to where you were, unemployed in Greenland? Vizzini glares at him, then turns, leaves them. During this, Inigo has gone close to , who is very distressed at the insults he's just received. As Inigo casts off. (softly) That Vizzini, he can fuss. (a slight emphasis on the last word) (looking at Inigo) ... fuss ... fuss ... (Suddenly, he's got it again, emphasis on the last word.) think he likes to scream at us. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 12. Probably he means no harm. He's really very short on charm. (proudly) Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme. Yes, some of the time. (he starts to smile) (whirling on them) Enough of that. As they sail off, we hear their voices as the boat recedes. , are there rocks ahead? If there are, we'll all be dead. No more rhymes now, mean it. Anybody want a peanut? As Vizzini screams we: : Inigo is at the helm, stands near the body of the princess, whose eyelids flutter slightly -- or do they? Vizzini sits motionless. The waves are higher, there are only occasional flashes of moon slanting down between clouds. (to Inigo) We'll reach the Cliffs by dawn. Inigo nods, glances back. Why are you doing that? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 13. Making sure nobody's following us. That would be inconceivable. Despite what you think, you will be caught. And when you are, the Prince will see you all hanged. Vizzini turns a cold eye on the Princess. Of all the necks on this boat, Highness, the one you should be worrying about is your own. Inigo keeps staring behind them. Stop doing that. We can all relax, it's almost over- You're sure nobody's following us? As told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask? No reason. It's only, just happened to look behind us, and something is there. What? And suddenly the three whirl, stare back and as they do -- : It's hard to see; the moon is behind clouds now. But the wind whistles. And the waves pound. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 14. And suddenly it's all gone ominous. : , , squinting back, trying desperately to see. At this moment, they are all holding their breaths. : And there's still nothing to be seen. It's still ominous. Only now it's eerie too. Then -- The moon slips through and -- Inigo was right -- something is very much there. sailboat. Black. With a great billowing sail. Black. It's a good distance behind them, but it's coming like hell, closing the gap. : , , staring at the other boat. (explaining with as much logic as he can muster) Probably some local fisherman out for a pleasure cruise at night through eel-infested waters. And now as a sound comes from their boat they turn as we : , diving into the water, starting to swim away. : and Vizzini screaming. Go in, get after her! don't swim. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 15. (to the unasked question) only dog paddle. Veer left. Left. Left! : still close to the boat, switching from a crawl to a silent breast stroke. The wind dies and as it does, something new is heard. not-too-distant high-pitched shrieking sound. Buttercup stops suddenly, treads water. : Do you know what that sound is, Highness? Those are the Shrieking Eels -- if you doubt me, just wait. They always grow louder when they're about to feed on human flesh. : , treading water, still not far from the boat. The shrieking sounds are getting louder and more terrifying. Buttercup stays silent. : If you swim back now, promise, no harm will come to you. doubt you will get such an offer from the Eels. : , and she's a gutsy girl. The shrieking sound is louder still, but she doesn't make a sound. Behind her now, something dark and gigantic slithers past. She's scared, sure, petrified, who wouldn't be, but she makes no reply -- -- and now a has zeroed in on her -- --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 16. -- and now she sees it, a short distance away, circling, starting to close -- -- and Buttercup is frozen, trying not to make a movement of any kind -- -- and the Eel slithers closer, closer -- -- and Buttercup knows it now, there's nothing she can do, it's over, all over -- -- and now the Eel opens its mouth wide, and it's never made such a noise, and as its great jaws are about to clamp down -- (off-screen) She doesn't get eaten by the Eels at this time. And the second we hear him: : ' The Kid looks the same, pale and weak, but maybe he's gripping the sheets a little too tightly with his hands. What? The Eel doesn't get her. 'm explaining to you because you looked nervous. Well, wasn't nervous. His Grandfather says nothing, just waits. Well, maybe was a little bit concerned. But that's not the same thing. Because can stop now if you want. No. You could read a little bit more ... if you want. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 17. He grips the sheets again, as the Grandfather picks up the book. (reading) ""Do you know what that sound is, Highness?"" : We're back in the boat. Those are the Shrieking Eels. (off-screen) We're past that, Grandpa. : ' You read it already. Oh. Oh my goodness, did. 'm sorry. Beg your pardon. : treading water. (off-screen) All right, all right, let's see. Uh, she was in the water, the Eel was coming after her. She was frightened. The Eel started to charge her. And then - And we're back where we were at the last moment we saw her, Buttercup frozen, the Shrieking Eel, jaws wide, about to clamp down as we : --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 18. pounding the Eel unconscious in one move, then easily lifting Buttercup. The boat and , Buttercup being deposited on the deck. Put her down. Just put her down. : pointing behind them. think he's getting closer. Vizzini, tying Buttercup's hands. He's no concern of ours. Sail on! (to Buttercup) suppose you think you're brave, don't you? (staring deep at him) Only compared to some. : The boat at dawn, being followed closely by the black sailboat, which we can see for the first time is being sailed by a , and his boat almost seems to be flying. Look! He's right on top of us. wonder if he is using the same wind we are using. Whoever he is, he's too late -- (pointing ahead of them) -- see?

And once he's said the name-- : - They rise straight up, sheer from the water, impossibly high. : in a wild race for the Cliffs and the Man In Black is closing faster than ever, but not fast enough, the lead was too great to overcome, and as Inigo sails with great precision straight at the Cliffs : being pursued. Hurry up. Move the thing! Um ... that other thing. Move it! (staring back now) We're safe -- only is strong enough to go up our way -- he'll have to sail around for hours 'til he finds a harbor. There is much activity going on, all of it swift, expert, economical. reaches up along the Cliff face, grabs a jutting rock, reaches behind it. Suddenly there is a thick rope in his hands. He drops back to the boat, gives the rope a freeing swing and : The rope goes all the way to the top. : hurrying to . He straps a harness to him, then lifts Buttercup and Vizzini in the harness. Finally, he himself gets in the harness. All three are strapped to like papooses. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 20. And he starts to ascend the rope, carrying them all along with him as he goes. : , sailing in toward the Cliffs of Insanity, watching as rises swiftly through the first moments of dawn. : - ' is only faintly visible far below. This is the first time we've gotten the real vertigo feeling and it's a gasper. : . Buttercup is almost out of her mind with fear. : is moving right along; however high they are, he's already over a third of the way done. : leaping from his ship to the rope, starting to climb. He's impossibly far behind, but the way he goes you'd think he didn't know that because he is flying up the rope, hand over hand like lightning. : (looking down) He's climbing the rope. And he's gaining on us. Inconceivable! He prods , who nods, increases his pace. : --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 21. roaring up the rope, and : - -- and the Man In Black is cutting deeply into 's lead. : (shrieking) Faster! thought was going faster. You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains. Well, 'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself. (cutting through) -- do not accept excuses. (shaking his head) 'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all. (hurt) Don't say that, Vizzini. Please. And his arms begin moving much more slowly. : His arms still work as before. If anything, he has speeded up. 's lead is smaller and smaller : --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 22. Maybe a hundred feet for to go. Maybe more. : , and it's getting too close now. Did make it clear that your job is at stake? : less than a hundred feet behind them. And gaining. : ! Vizzini leaps off and takes out a knife, begins to cut the rope which is tied around a great rock while Inigo helps the Princess to her feet and just stands around, waiting for someone to tell him to do something. Nearby are some stone ruins. Once they might have been a fort, now the kind of resemble Stonehenge. : feet from the top now, maybe less -- maybe only 50 -- and his pace is as dazzling as before, and : cutting through the last of the rope and : slithering across the ground and out of sight toward the Channel, like some great serpent at last going home. : standing with Inigo and Buttercup by the cliff edge. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 23. (to Inigo -- impressed) He has very good arms. : hanging suspended hundreds of feet in the air, holding to the jagged rocks, desperately trying to cling to life. : stunned, turning to the others, looking down. He didn't fall? Inconceivable!! (whirling on Vizzini) You keep using that word -- do not think it means what you think it means. (looks down again) My God! He's climbing. : and so he is. Very slowly, he is picking his way upwards, sometimes a foot at a time, sometimes an inch. : The group at the top, staring down. Whoever he is, he's obviously seen us with the Princess, and must therefore die. (to Fezzik) You, carry her. (to Inigo) We'll head straight for the Guilder frontier. Catch up when he's dead. If he falls, fine. If not, the sword. Inigo nods. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 24. want to duel him left-handed. You know what a hurry we're in. Well, it's the only way can be satisfied. If use my right -- tch -- over too quickly. (turns abruptly, starts off-screen) Oh, have it your way. : still creeping his way upward. : who goes to Inigo. You be careful. (gravely) -- people in masks cannot be trusted. (calling out) 'm waiting! nods, hurries after Vizzini. : He watches them depart, then turns, peers down over the Cliffs. He watches a moment, then paces, shaking his hands loose. He practices a few of his honed fencing skills. He is a taut and nervous fellow, and has never been one for waiting around. : --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 25. climbing on. He must be six inches closer to the top than when last we saw him. Inigo is watching. : walking away. Finally he goes back to cliff edge, starts to talk. It's instant death if the Man In Black falls, but neither gives that possibility much credence. This is our two heroes meeting. They don't know it yet; but that's what it is. (hollering down) Hello there. The Man In Black glances up, kind of grunts. Slow going? Look, don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So 'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me. Sorry. Thank you. Inigo steps away, draws his sword, loosens up with a few perfect thrusts. Then resheathes and looks eagerly over the edge again. do not suppose you could speed things up? (with some beat) If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 26. could do that. In fact, 've got some rope up here. But do not think that you will accept my help, since am only waiting around to kill you. That does put a damper on our relationship. He finds another bold a few inches higher. But promise will not kill you until you reach the top. That's very comforting. But 'm afraid you'll just have to wait. hate waiting. could give you my word as a Spaniard. No good. 've known too many Spaniards. And he just hangs there in space, resting, gathering his strength. You don't know any way you'll trust me? Nothing comes to mind. And on these words, into a on Inigo. He raises his right hand high, his eyes blaze, and his voice takes on a tone we have not heard before. swear on the soul of my father, Domingo Montoya, you will reach the top alive. : . There is a pause. Then, quietly: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 27. Throw me the rope. : He dashes to the giant rock the rope was originally tied to. : as his grip loosens a moment, trying to cling to the side of the cliff. : now with a small coil of rope, hurries back to the edge and hurls it over -- : It hangs close to the Man In Black. He releases the rocks, grabs the rope, hangs helplessly in space a moment, then looks up at Inigo and -- : straining, forcing his body away from the cliff edge and -- : rising through the early morning light, slowly, steadily, and as the cliff top at last comes within reach -- : watching as the Man In Black crawls to safety, then looks to Inigo. (pulling his sword) Thank you. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 28. We'll wait until you're ready. Again. Thank you. The Man In Black sits to rest on the boulder that once held the rope. He tugs off his leather boots and is amazed to see several large rocks tumble out. The Man In Black wears gloves. Inigo stares at them. do not mean to pry, but you don't by any chance happen to have six fingers on your right hand? He glances up -- the question clearly baffles him. Do you always begin conversations this way? My father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. And when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He slaved a year before he was done. He hands his sword to the Man In Black. (fondling it-impressed) have never seen its equal. : - Even now, this still brings pain. The six-fingered man returned and demanded it, but at one-tenth his promised price. My father refused. Without a word, the six-fingered man slashed him through the heart. loved my father, so, naturally, challenged his murderer to a duel ... failed ... () --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 29. (') the six-fingered man did leave me alive with the six-fingered sword, but he gave me these. He touches his scars. : looking up at Inigo. How old were you? was eleven years old. When was strong enough, dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, will not fail. will go up to the sixfingered man and say, ""Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."" You've done nothing but study swordplay? More pursuit than study lately. You see, cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. am starting to lose confidence. just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge. (handing back the great sword, starting to rise) Well, certainly hope you find him, someday. You are ready, then? Whether am or not, you've been more than fair. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 30. You seem a decent fellow. hate to kill you. (walking away a few paces, unsheathing his sword) You seem a decent fellow. hate to die. Begin! And on that word -- : And what we are starting now is one of the two greatest sword fights in modern movies (the other one happens later on), and right from the beginning it looks different. Because they aren't close to each other -- none of the swordscrossing ""en garde"" garbage. No, what we have here is two men, two athletes, and they look to be too faraway to damage each other, but each time one makes even the tiniest feint, the other counters, and there is silence, and as they start to circle -- : - feinting here, feinting there and -- : finished teasing, begin to duel in earnest. Their swords cross, then again, again, and the sound comes so fast it's almost continual. Inigo presses on, the Man In Black retreating up a rocky incline. (thrilled) You're using Bonetti's defense against me, ah? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 31. thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain -- Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro. And he shifts his style now. (coping as best he can) -- naturally -- (suddenly shifting again) --but find Thibault cancels out Capo Ferro, don't you? The Man In Black is now perched at the edge of the elevated castle ruin. No where to go, he jumps to the sand. Inigo stares down at him. Unless the enemy has studied his Agrippa- And now, with the grace of an Olympian, Inigo flies off the perch, somersaults clean over the Man In Black's head, and lands facing his opponent. -- which have. The two men are almost flying across the rocky terrain, never losing balance, never coming close to stumbling; the battle rages with incredible finesse, first one and then the other gaining the advantage, and by now, it's clear that this isn't just two athletes going at it, it's a lot more that that. This is two legendary swashbucklers and they're in their prime, it's Burt Lancaster in ""The Crimson Pirate"" battling Errol Flynn in ""Robin Hood"" and then, incredibly, the action begins going even faster than before as we : And behind him now, drawing closer all the time, is the deadly edge of the Cliffs of Insanity. Inigo fights and ducks and feints and slashes and it all works, but not for long, as gradually the Man In Black keeps the advantage, keeps forcing Inigo back, closer and closer to death. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 32. (happy as a clam) You are wonderful! Thank you -- 've worked hard to become so. The Cliff edge is very close now. Inigo is continually being forced toward it. admit it -- you are better than am. Then why are you smiling? Inches from defeat, Inigo is, in fact, all smiles. Because know something you don't know. And what is that? am not left-handed. And he throws the six-fingered sword into his right hand and immediately, the tide of battle turns. : stunned, doing everything be can to keep Inigo by the Cliff edge. But no use. Slowly at first, he begins to retreat. Now faster, Inigo is in control and the Man In Black is desperate. : and the six-fingered sword is all but invisible now, as he increases his attack, then suddenly switches styles again. : --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 33. leading to a turret-shaped plateau, and the Man In Black is retreating like mad up the steps and he can't stop Inigo -- nothing can stop Inigo -- and in a frenzy, the Man In Black makes every feint, tries every thrust, lets go with all he has left. But he fails. Everything fails. He tries one or two final desperate moves but they are nothing. You're amazing! ought to be after twenty years. And now the Man In Black is smashed into a stone pillar, pinned there under the six fingered sword. (hollering it out) There's something ought to tell you. Tell me. am not left-handed either. And now he changes hands, and at last, the battle is fully joined. : And to his amazement, he is being forced back down the steps. He tries one style, another, but it all comes down to the same thing -- the Man In Black seems to be in control. And before Inigo knows it, the six-fingered sword is knocked clear out of his hand. Inigo retreats, dives from the stairs to a moss-covered bar suspended over the archway. He swings out, lands, and scrambles to his sword and we : who watches Inigo, then casually tosses his sword to the landing where it sticks in perfectly. Then the Man In Black copies . Not copies exactly, improves. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 34. He dives to the bar, swings completely over it like a circus performer and dismounts with a backflip. : staring in awe. Who are you?! No one of consequence. must know. Get used to disappointment. Okay. : moving like lightning, and he thrusts forward, slashes, darts back, all in almost a single movement and -- : Dodging, blocking, and again he thrusts forward, faster even than before, and again he slashes but -- : And there is never a move anyone makes he doesn't remember, and this time he blocks the slash, slashes out himself with the sixfingered sword. On it goes, back and forth across the rocky terrain, Inigo's feet moving with the grace and speed of a great improvisational dancer. : --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 35. - as it is knocked free, arching up into the air, and -- : catching it again. And something terrible is written behind his eyes: he has given his all, done everything man can do, tried every style, made every maneuver, but it wasn't enough, and on his face for all to see is the realization that he, Inigo Montoya of Spain, is going to lose. : moving in for the end now, blocking everything, muzzling everything and : - sent flying from Inigo's grip. He stands helpless only a moment. Then be drops to his knees, bows his head, shuts his eyes. Kill me quickly. would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself. However, since can't have you following me either -- And he dunks Inigo's head with his heavy sword handle. Inigo pitches forward unconscious. Please understand, hold you in the highest respect. He grabs his scabbard and takes off after the Princess and we : : Inconceivable! --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 36. Vizzini, staring down from a narrow mountain path, as far below the Man In Black can be seen running. , carrying the Princess, stands alongside. It's a little later in the morning. Give her to me. (grabs Buttercup starts off) Catch up with us quickly. (starting to panic) What do do? Finish him, finish him. Your way. Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini. (little pause) Which way is my way? : Nothing gigantic. Vizzini points to them. There is a large boulder nearby. Pick up one of those rocks, get behind the boulder, and in a few minutes, the Man in Black will come running around the bend. The minute his head is in view, hit it with the rock! As Vizzini and Buttercup hurry away. (little frown; softly) My way's not very sportsmanlike. He grabs one of the rocks and plods behind the boulder and we -- : --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 37. racing up the mountain trail. Ahead is a bend in the trail. He sees it, slows. Then he stops, listening. Satisfied by the silence, he starts forward again and as he rounds the bend -- a rock flies , shattering on a boulder inches in front of him. : He moves into the mountain path. He has picked up another rock and holds it lightly. did that on purpose. don't have to miss. believe you -- So what happens now? We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone. You mean, you'll put down your rock and 'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people? (gently) could kill you now. He gets set to throw, but the Man In Black shakes his head, takes off his sword and scabbard, begins the approach toward the Giant. Frankly, think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting. It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. don't even exercise. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 38. He flips the rock away. : The Man In Black is not now and has never been a shrimp. But it's like he wasn't even there, towers over him so much. There is a moment's pause, and then the Man In Black dives at 's chest, slams him several tremendous blows in the stomach, twists his arm severely, slips skillfully into a beautifully applied bear hug, and in general makes any number of terrific wrestling moves. just stands there, kind of taking in the scenery. Finally the Man In Black pushes himself away, stares up at the Giant. Look are you just fiddling around with me or what? just want you to feel you're doing well. hate for people to die embarrassed. They get set to begin again. Then suddenly -- : as he jumps forward with stunning speed for anyone his size and reaches for the Man In Black who drops to his knees, spins loose, and slips between the Giant's legs. You're quick. And a good thing too. (getting set for another onslaught) Why do you wear a mask? Were you burned by acid, or something like that? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 39. Oh no. It's just that they're terribly comfortable. think everyone will be wearing them in the future. considers this a moment, then attacks, and if he moved quickly last time, this time he is blinding and as the Man In Black slips down to avoid the charge, moves right with him, only instead of twisting free and jumping to his feet, this time the Man In Black jumps for 's back and in a moment he is riding him, and his arms have 's throat, locked across 's windpipe, one in front, one behind. The Man In Black begins to squeeze. Tighter. (standing, talking as he does so) just figured out why you give me so much trouble. : as he charges toward a huge rock that lines the path, and just as he reaches it he spins his giant body so that the entire weight of the charge is taken by the Man In Black. : And the power of the charge is terrible, the pain enormous, but he clings to his grip at 's windpipe. (his arms never leave Fezzik's throat) Why is that, do you think? (his voice just beginning to get a little strained) Well, haven't fought just one person for so long. 've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing. : --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 40. Again charges, slower this time, but still a charge, and again he spins and creams the Man In Black against the rough boulder. : And the punishment is terrible, and for a moment it seems as if he is going to let go of Fezzik's windpipe and crumble, but he doesn't, he holds on. Why should that make such a difference? Well ... (And now his voice is definitely growing weaker) ... you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one. Again slams the Man In Black against a boulder, only this time his power has diminished and Fezzik starts to slowly collapse. : and there isn't much breath coming. : holding his grip as tries to stand, halfway makes it, but there is no air. Back to his knees he falls, holds there for a moment, and pitches down to all fours. The Man In Black increases the pressure. tries to crawl. But there is just no air. No air. goes to earth and lies still. : as the Man In Black turns him over, puts his ear to 's heart. It beats. The Man In Black stands. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 41. don't envy you the headache you will have when you awake. But, in the meantime, rest well ... and dream of large women. And he nimbly scoops up his sword with his foot, catches it and as he dashes off up along the mountain path -- : as he slips his boot into a foot print in the sand. Count Rugen mounted, watches. Behind him, half a dozen armed , also mounted. waits riderless in front. Humperdinck is all over the rocky ground, and maybe he isn't the best hunter in the world. Then again, maybe he is. Because, as he begins to put his feet into strange positions, we realize that what he is doing is miming the fencers. There was a mighty duel -- it ranged all over. They were both masters. Who won? How did it end? (looking down in the position where Inigo fell unconscious) The loser ran off alone. (points in the direction Vizzini and took) The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder! Shall we track them both? The loser is nothing. -- Only the Princess matters -- (to the armed warriors) -- clearly this was all planned by warriors of Guilder. We must be ready for whatever lies ahead. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 42. Could this be a trap? (vaulting onto his horse) always think everything could be a trap -- Which is why 'm still alive. And he gallops off -- : cresting the peak of the mountain. : - a knife pointed at a throat -- Vizzini munching on an apple, holding the knife to Buttercup's throat. She is blindfolded. is laid out. tablecloth, two goblets and between them, a small leather wine container. And some cheese and a couple of apples. The picnic is set on a lovely spot, high on the edge of a mountain path with a view all the way back to the sea. The Man In Black comes running around the path, sees Vizzini, slows. The two men study each other. Then -- So, it is down to you. And it is down to me. The Man In Black nods and comes nearer -- If you wish her dead, by all means keep moving forward. And he pushes his long knife harder against Buttercup's unprotected throat. Let me explain- -- there's nothing to explain. You're trying to kidnap what 've rightfully stolen. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 43. Perhaps an arrangement can be reached. There will be no arrangement -- (deliberate) -- and you're killing her! : ' as Vizzini jabs with his long knife. Buttercup gasps against the pain. : stopping fast. But if there can be no arrangement, then we are at an impasse. 'm afraid so -- can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains. You're that smart? Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates? Yes. Morons. Really? In that case, challenge you to a battle of wits. For the Princess? The Man In Black nods. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 44. To the death? Another nod. accept. Good. Then pour the wine. As Vizzini fills the goblets with the dark red liquid, the Man In Black pulls a small packet from his clothing, handing it to Vizzini. Inhale this, but do not touch. (doing it) smell nothing. (taking the packet back) What you do not smell is called iocane powder. It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man. Hmm. : watching excitedly as the Man In Black takes the goblets, turns his back. moment later, he turns again, faces Vizzini, drops the iocane packet. It is now empty. The Man In Black rotates the goblets in a little shell game maneuver then puts one glass in front of Vizzini, the other in front of himself. All right: where is the poison? The battle of wits has begun. It ends when you decide and we both drink, and find out who is right and who is dead. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 45. But it's so simple. All have to do is divine from what know of you. Are you the sort of man who would put the poison into his own goblet, or his enemy's? He studies the Man In Black now. Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. 'm not a great fool, so can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. (And now there's a trace of nervousness beginning) You've made your decision then7 Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. Truly, you have a dizzying intellect. Wait till get going! Where was ? Australia. Yes -- Australia, and you must have suspected would have known the powder's origin, so can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 46. (very nervous) You're just stalling now. (cackling) You'd like to think that, wouldn't you? (stares at the Man in Black) You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. As Vizzini's pleasure has been growing throughout, the Man In Black's has been fast disappearing. You're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work -- (triumphant) It has worked -- you've given everything away -- know where the poison is. (fool's courage) Then make your choice. will. And choose -- And suddenly he stops, points at something behind the Man In Black. -- what in the world can that be? : --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 47. turning around, looking. What? Where? don't see anything. : busily switching the goblets while the Man In Black has his head turned. Oh, well, - could have sworn saw something. No matter. The Man In Black turns to face him again. Vizzini starts to laugh. What's so funny? 'll tell you in a minute. First, let's drink -- me from my glass, and you from yours. And he picks up his goblet. The Man In Black picks up the one in front of him. As they both start to drink, Vizzini hesitates a moment. Then, allowing the Man In Black to drink first, he swallows his wine. You guessed wrong. (roaring with laughter) You only think guessed wrong -- (louder now) -- that's what's so funny! switched glasses when your back was turned. You fool. : There's nothing he can say. He just sits there. : --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 48. watching him. You fell victim to one of the classic blunders. The most famous is ""Never get involved in a land war in Asia."" But only slightly less well known is this: ""Never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line."" He laughs and roars and cackles and whoops and is in all ways quite cheery until he falls over dead. : stepping past the corpse, taking the blindfold and bindings off Buttercup, who notices Vizzini lying dead. The Man In Black pulls her to her feet. Who are you? am no one to be trifled with, that is all you ever need know. He starts to lead her off the mountain path into untraveled terrain. (a final glance back toward Vizzini) To think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned. They were both poisoned. spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder. And with that, he takes off, dragging her behind him. : --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 49. It's where fought the Man in Black. the Prince, kneeling, inspecting every grain of misplaced sand. The others wait behind him. Someone has beaten a giant! (roaring) There will be great suffering in Guilder if she dies. He leaps onto his horse and they charge off. : The Man In Black comes running into view, still dragging Buttercup, who sometimes stumbles, but he keeps forcing her along. Finally, when she is close to exhaustion, he lets go of her. (his voice harsh now, carrying the promise of violence) Catch your breath. If you'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you'll get it, promise you... And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness. was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you You think your dearest love will save you? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 50. never said he was my dearest love. And yes, he will save me. That know. You admit to me you do not love your fiance? He knows do not love him. ""Are not capable of love"" is what you mean. have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream. And the Man In Black cocks back a fist. Buttercup flinches, but does not retreat. That was a warning, Highness. The next time, my hand flies on its own. For where come from, there are penalties when a woman lies. : ' The picnic is spread as before. the Prince kneeling by the body as the others ride up. The Prince grabs the empty poison packet, hands it to Rugen, after first sniffing it himself. Iocane. 'd bet my life on it. (gestures to the trail ahead) And there are the Princess's footprints. She is alive ... or was, an hour ago. If she is otherwise when find her, shall be very put out. And as he vaults onto his horse and the all charge off -- : --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 51. being spun view, falling heavily as the Man In Black releases her. We are at the edge of an almost sheer ravine. The drop is sharp and severe. Below, the ravine floor is flat, but getting there would not be half the fun. Rest, Highness. (stares at him) know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything. The Man In Black says nothing. You're the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit it. (bowing) With pride. What can do for you? You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces. Hardly complimentary, Your Highness. Why loose your venom on me? - , quietly now. You killed my love. : watching her closely. It's possible; kill a lot of people. Who was this love of yours? Another Prince, like this one, ugly, rich, and scabby? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 52. No. farm boy. Poor. Poor and perfect, with eyes like the sea after a storm. : And probably, if she did not hate Roberts so, there would be tears. On the high seas, your ship attacked, and the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners. (explaining as a teacher might) can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time. You mock my pain! Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something. remember this farm boy of yours, think. This would be, what, five years ago? Buttercup nods. Does it bother you to hear? Nothing you can say will upset me. He died well, that should please you. No bribe attempts or blubbering. He simply said, ""Please. Please, need to live."" It was the ""please"" that caught my memory. () --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 53. (') asked him what was so important for him. ""True love,"" he replied. And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness. can only assume he meant you. You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are. And what am ? Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead? You mocked me once, never do it again -- died that day! The Man In Black is about to reply as they stand there on the edge of the sheer ravine. But then something catches his attention and as he stares at it briefly, : ...: The dust cloud caused by Humperdinck's is rising up into the sky. : and while his attention is on the dust cloud, rising high, she pushes him with all the strength she has. You can die too, for all care!! : teetering on the ravine edge, for a moment, then he begins to fall. Down goes the Man In Black. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 54. Down, down, rolling, spinning, crashing always down toward the flat rock floor of the ravine. : staring transfixed at what she has wrought. There is a long pause. She stands there, alone, as from far below the words come to her, drifting on the wind -- ... as ... you ... wish... Oh, my sweet Westley; what have done? And without a second thought or consideration of the dangers, she starts into the ravine. moment later, she too is falling, spinning and twisting, crashing and torn, cartwheeling down toward what is left of her beloved. : rising. Prince Humperdinck and the others reining in at the spot where Buttercup promised ransom in exchange for her freedom. The Prince shakes his head. Disappeared. He must have seen us closing in, which might account for his panicking in error. Unless 'm wrong, and am never wrong, they are headed dead into the fire swamp. : The mere mention of the Fire Swamp makes him pale. : --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 55. lie a few feet apart, not moving. It is, of course, Buttercup and Westley. They might be corpses. After a time, Westley slowly forces his body into motion and as he does, : bruised and torn, as Westley crawls slowly toward her. Can you move at all? (weakly stretching out an arm toward him) Move? You're alive. If you want, can fly. told you, "" would always come for you."" Why didn't you wait for me? Well ... you were dead. Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while. will never doubt again. There will never be a need. And now, they begin to kiss; it's a tender kiss, tender and loving and gentle and -- (off-screen) Oh no. No, please. : ' What is it? What's the matter? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 56. They're kissing again, do we have to hear the kissing part? Someday, you may not mind so much. Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good. Oh. You're sick, 'll humor you. (he picks up the book again) So now, where were we here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley and Buttercup raced along the ravine floor. : racing along the ravine floor. Westley glances up. : perched on top of the cliff, looking down at Westley and Buttercup. : Ha. Your pig fiance is too late. few more steps and we'll be safe in the Fire Swamp. : and Westley has tried to say it with Chevalier-like nonchalance, but she ain't buying. We'll never survive. Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 57. As they race off, leaving Humperdinck and his men stranded, defeated. : And it really doesn't look any worse than any other moist, sulphurous, infernal horror you might run across. Great trees block the sun. : Buttercup is clearly panicked and maybe Westley is too, but he moves jauntily along, sword in hand. It's not that bad. 'm not saying 'd like to build a summer home here, but the trees are actually quite lovely. , thick and black-green, look ominous as hell and they shield all but intermittent stripes of sun. leaps up, preceded by a slight popping sound, and this particular spurt of flame misses Westley, but Buttercup is suddenly onfire; at least the lower half of her is and -- : instantly forcing Buttercup to sit, gathering her flaming hem in his hands, doing his best to suffocate the fire. This isn't all that easy and it causes him a bit of grief, but he does his best to sound as jaunty as before. Well now, that was an adventure. He examines where the flames burst over her. Singed a bit, were you? (She wasn't and she shakes her head ""no"") You? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 58. He was, and he shakes his head ""no."" As he pulls her to her feet -- : -- and as there's another popping sound, : pulling her aside to safety as another great spun of flame suddenly shoots up. Well, one thing will say. The Fire Swamp certainly does keep you on your toes. Buttercup is frozen with fear. He takes her hand, gently leads her forward as we- : moving slowly along through a particularly dangerous part of the Fire Swamp. It's later now, the sun slants down at a slightly different angle. (happily) This will all soon be but a happy memory because Roberts' ship ""Revenge"" is anchored at the far end. And , as you know, am Roberts. But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago? myself am often surprised at life's little quirks. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 59. There is again a popping sound, then a huge spurt of flame. Westley simply picks up Buttercup as they walk along, moves her out of danger, puts her back down, goes right on talking without missing a beat. You see, what told you before about saying ""please"" was true. It intrigued Roberts, as did my descriptions of your beauty. : -- they look like they could be flesh eating. Westley takes his sword, slices a path for them to follow. The vines groan as they fall. He's been chatting away the entire time. Finally, Roberts decided something. He said, ""All right, Westley, 've never had a valet. You can try it for tonight. 'll most likely kill you in the morning."" Three years he said that. ""Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. 'll most likely kill you in the morning."" It was a fine time for me. was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me. And Roberts and eventually became friends. And then it happened. What? -- go on -- Westley picks her up, carrying her across some swamp water that is bridged by a narrow, rickety tree branch. Well, Roberts had grown so rich, he wanted to retire. So he took me to his cabin and told me his secret. "" am not the Dread Pirate Roberts,"" he said. ""My name is Ryan. inherited this ship from the previous Dread Pirate Roberts, just as you will inherit it from me. The man inherited it from was not the real Dread Pirate Roberts, either. () --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 60. (') His name was Cummerbund. The real Roberts has been retired fifteen years and living like a king in Patagonia."" Then he explained the name was the important thing for inspiring the necessary fear. You see, no one would surrender to the Dread Pirate Westley. The two of them have by now crossed the pond. So we sailed ashore, took on an entirely new crew and he stayed aboard for awhile as first mate, all the time calling me Roberts. Once the crew believed, he left the ship and have been Roberts ever since. Except, now that we're together, shall retire and hand the name over to someone else. Is everything clear to you? Buttercup, perplexed, is about to reply but the ground she steps on gives way -- it's Lightning Sand -- a great patch of it, and it has her -- a cloud of powder rises and she sinks into the stuff crying Westley's name but then she is gone as we -- : slashing at a -shaped vine, hacks it in half -- it's still connected to the tree. Then be grabs it, drops his sword, and, clutching the other end of the vine, he dives into the lightning sand and there is another cloud of white powder, but it settles quickly. Now nothing can be seen. Nothing at all. Just the lightning sand, lovely and lethal. -- -- An odd panting sound is heard now. The panting sound is suddenly very loud. And then a giant .0... darts into view. The .0... -- a Rodent of Unusual Size -- is probably no more than eighty pounds of bone and power. It sniffs around a bit then, as quickly as it has come, it goes. : --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 61. as Westley, lungs long past the bursting point, explodes out; he has Buttercup across his shoulders and as he pulls to the edge of the lightning sand pit, using the vine -- : - - Her face is caked with the white powder. It is in her eyes, her ears, hair, mouth. She's still probably beautiful, but you have to look awfully hard to see it. As Westley continues to pull them to safety -- : .0... high above them; it watches -- : placed against a tree. Westley is cleaning the lightning sand from her face. He hesitates, glances around and : .0... on a much lower branch now. It stares down at Westley. Westley stares back up at the beast. Buttercup is oblivious. Her eyes flutter. He continues to work on her as -- We'll never succeed -- we may as well die here. No. No. We have already succeeded. He glances back again. Now .0...'s. The have climbed into a nearby tree, stare hungrily down. : , picking her up. He puts an arm around her, starts to walk with her as he encouragingly goes on talking. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 62. mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurts. No problem. There's a popping sound preceding each, we can avoid that. Two, the Lightning Sand. But you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too. Westley, what about the ....'s? Rodents of Unusual Size? don't think they exist... And as he says that, a .0... comes flying at him from offscreen. : screaming and -- Westley, pinned under the attacking .0..., trying to fend it off. Can't. The thing's teeth sink deep into his arm. He howls. Westley drives a fist into the beast's face, rolling it off. He reaches for his sword just a few feet away, but the .0... is back atop him. It's a fierce battle, and just when we think Westley can't possibly win, he flips the ugly rodent clear. Westley scrambles for his sword. The .0... stampedes on, changing its target, heading right for -- Buttercup, and she's scared to death and -- Westley! Westley abandons his sword, reaching for the rodent, grabbing only a tail, wrestling with it. Buttercup grabs a small branch, and using it as a club, beats the skull of the thing, doing pretty well, but the beast manages to snag her hem with its razor teeth, and she's pulled to the ground, and : --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 63. jumping onto its back, and the .0... is all over him now, sinking needle teeth into Westley's shoulder. : with death close at hand, as a popping sound starts. He tries one desperate move, rolls into the sound -- : shooting skyward and -- : with the .0... pinned under him, and as the beast bursts into flame, it lets go and Westley rolls safely free, grabs his sword and exhaustedly stabs the .0..., which is trying to put itself out. The .0... collapses dead. Westley stands motionless, exhausted. The danger has passed. : relieved. : Beyond, a beach. : (almost in disbelief) We did it. Now, was that so terrible? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 64. And from somewhere they summon strength, pick up their pace, and as they reach the edge of the Fire Swamp -- : ' : Humperdinck on his horse, Rugen beside him. , armed and ready, are mounted in formation behind. Buttercup and Westley are at the edge of the Fire Swamp, about to leave it. They stop. Buttercup looks beyond exhaustion. Westley looks worse. Surrender! It's dusk. Behind Humperdinck are the waters of the bay. : staring out at the others. You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, accept. give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool. Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit. tell you once again -- surrender! It will not happen! : looking from one to the other; then something else catches her eye and we -- : --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 65. in shadow, with a loaded crossbow aimed at Westley's heart. : looking the other way -- : crossbow aimed at Westley. (roaring) For the last time -- ! (roaring right back, bigger) !! : frantically staring around, and now : crossbow stretched, ready to shoot; this one is hidden in a tree blocking any escape Westley might try. Will you promise not to hurt him? : whirling to face her. What was that? : whirling to face her. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 66. What was that? : talking to them both. If we surrender, and return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man? May live a thousand years and never hunt again. (looks at Westley) He is a sailor on the pirate ship ""Revenge."" Promise to return him to his ship. swear it will be done. : staring deep into each other's eyes. : (whispering) Once we're out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair. (almost a smile) swear it will be done. : thought you were dead once, and it almost destroyed me. could not bear it if you died again, not when could save you. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 67. Westley is dazed. Silent. Buttercup tries to speak again, can't, and is swooped off her feet onto Humperdinck's horse, and off they go. : staring after her. Rugen watches as his warriors bring Westley to him. The Count has a heavy sword and he holds it in his hand. Come, sir. We must get you to your ship. We are men of action. Lies do not become us. Well spoken, sir -- Westley is looking at him. -- what is it? You have six fingers on your right hand -- someone was looking for you -- Count Rugen clubs Westley hard across the skull. Westley starts to fall --the screen goes black. : Dank and chill, underground and windowless, lit by flickering torches. Frightening. Westley lies in the center of the cage, chained and helpless. : : - Dead pale, he silently enters the pit, carrying a tray of food and medication. He puts it down. Where am ? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 68. (he only whispers) The Pit of Despair. He begins tending Westley's wounds. Westley winces. (garbled) Don't even think -- ( hack, sputter, cough - now his voice seems normal again) -- don't even think about trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. And don't dream of being rescued either. The only way in is secret. And only the Prince, the Count, and know how to get in and out. Then 'm here till die? (working away) Till they kill you. Yeah. Then why bother curing me? The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken. So it's to be torture. The albino nods. can cope with torture. The albino shakes his head. You don't believe me? You survived the Fire Swamp. You must be very brave... (little pause) ... but nobody withstands The Machine. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 69. He studies Westley, whose face is almost sad. : and her face is sad. Pallid, perhaps ill. She wanders down a corridor in Florin Castle. As she moves unseeing past an intersecting corridor: : watching her. She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp. (looks at Rugen) It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her. (unbelieving) Of course. As they move on-- : - while we hear the Grandfather's voice reading. (off-screen) The King died that very night, and before the following dawn, Buttercup and Humperdinck were married. : And if we thought it was packed before, we didn't know how many more could fit in this courtyard. Humperdinck, Rugen and the Queen stand high on the balcony. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 70. (off-screen) And at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen. My father's final words were... (off-screen) -- hold it. Hold it, Grandpa. And the scene , Humperdinck caught in mid-sentence. : ' The Kid is half sitting now, not strong yet, but clearly stronger than when we first saw him. You read that wrong. She doesn't marry Humperdinck, she marries Westley. 'm just sure of it. After all that Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn't be fair. Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair. 'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right! Do you want me to go on with this? Yes. All right, then. No more interruptions. (starts to read again) ... at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen. And on these words-- : --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 71. My father's final words were ""love her as loved her, and there will be joy."" present to you your Queen. Queen Buttercup. And on his words-- : and it's gigantic. : we saw before, as Buttercup emerges. : suddenly going to its knees, wave after wave of silent . All of them down. : touched as before, but then she seems stunned as we : ! The gets louder as an approaches Buttercup through the crowd, every step of the way. Why do you do this? Because you had love in your hands, and you gave it up. (distraught) But they would have killed Westley if hadn't done it. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 72. Your true love lives and you marry another -- (to the crowd) -- True love saved her in the Fire Swamp, and she treated it like garbage. And that's what she is, the Queen of Refuse! So, bow down to her if you want. Bow to her. Bow to the Queen of Slime, the Queen of Filth, the Queen of Putrescence. Boo! Boo! Rubbish! Filth! Slime! Muck! Boo! Boo! She advances on Buttercup now, who is more and more panicked. - - Louder and louder and she shrieks vituperation at Buttercup, reaching out her old hands toward Buttercup's throat, and Buttercup is as frightened now as Dorothy was when the Witch went after her in ""The Wizard of Oz"", and suddenly, : coming out of her nightmare, alone in her castle bedroom. As she frantically grabs a robe and starts to run. (off-screen, still reading) It was ten days till the wedding. The King still lived, but Buttercup's nightmares were growing steadily worse. (off-screen) See? Didn't tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck? (off-screen) -- yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up. : bursting into the Prince's chambers. Count Rugen stands nearby. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 73. It comes to this: love Westley. always have. know now always will. If you tell me must marry you in ten days, please believe will be dead by morning. : Just stunned. Finally, softly, he begins to talk. could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off. (to Rugen) You returned this Westley to his ship? Yes. Then we will simply alert him. (to Buttercup now) Beloved, are you certain he still wants you? After all, it was you who did the leaving in the Fire Swamp. Not to mention that pirates are not known to be men of their words. My Westley will always come for me. suggest a deal. You write four copies of a letter. 'll send my four fastest ships. One in each direction. The Dread Pirate Roberts is always close to Florin this time of year. We'll run up the white flag and deliver your message. If Westley wants you, bless you both. If not ... please consider me as an alternative to suicide. Are we agreed? And she nods -- : --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 74. The trees are unusual in one respect: all of them are extraordinarily heavily knotted. Humperdinck and Rugen, walking into the grove of trees. Your Princess is really a winning creature. trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable. Oh, know. The people are quite taken with her. It's odd, but when hired Vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day, thought that was clever. But it's going to be so much more moving when strangle her on our wedding night. Once Guilder is blamed, the nation will be truly outraged. They'll demand we go to war. They are deeper into the grove now. Rugen is searching around. Now, where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find. (Finding the knot on the tree he hits it, and it opens, revealing a staircase leading underground.) Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley's got his strength back. am starting him on The Machine tonight. Tyrone, you know how much love watching you work. But, 've got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, My wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it. 'm swamped. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 75. Get some rest -- if you haven't got your health, you haven't got anything. Rugen smiles and hurries down the stairs as the tree slides back perfectly into place. : We can't tell quite what it is or what it does, but somehow it is unsettling. Count Rugen, dragging Westley up alongside the thing -- Levers and wheels and wires, you name it, it's there. Beautiful, isn't it? The Albino starts attaching suction cups to Westley. It took me half a lifetime to invent it. 'm sure you've discovered my deep and abiding interest in pain. At present 'm writing the definitive work on the subject. So want you to be totally honest with me on how The Machine makes you feel. : with numbers ranging from a low of ""1"" to a high of ""50."" Rugen goes to it. This being our first try, 'll use the lowest setting. And he turns the dial to ""1"". : --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 76. He has suction cups on his head now, on his temple, on his heart, his hands and feet. He says nothing, keeps control of himself : fiddling with his Machine a moment more. And then he opens the flood gate, water pours down the chute, turning the wheel, which in turn really gets The Machine going. : and he's lying on the table, and he's only flesh and the chains are metal and thick, but such is his desperation it almost seems he might break them. terrible sound comes from his throat, an incessant gasping. It keeps on coming as we finally : He switches off The Machine, picks up a large notebook and pen, sits in a chair. The of The Machine subsides. Rugen opens the book to a blank page. As you know, the concept of the suction pump is centuries old. Well, really, that's all this is. Except that instead of sucking water, 'm sucking life. 've just sucked one year of your life away. might one day go as high as five, but really don't know what that would do to you. So, let's just start with what we have. What did this do to you? Tell me. And remember, this is for posterity, so be honest -- how do you feel? , : : --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 77. in anguish so deep it is dizzying. Helpless, he cries. Count Rugen watches the tears, then starts to write. Interesting. : in his quarters, swamped. Piles of papers are strewn all over. Now , a pale, shifty, quick-eyed man appears in the doorway. Yellin. (bows, then kneels) Sire. As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night. My spy network has heard no such news. : entering. Any word from Westley? : turning to her in the doorway. Too soon, my angel. Patience. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 78. He will come for me. Of course. As she glides out-- She will not be murdered. On the day of the wedding, want the Thieves' Forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested. Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate. Form a Brute Squad then. want the Thieves' Forest emptied before wed. It won't be easy, Sire. (alone, exhausted) Try ruling the world sometime. : ' - lot of hollering is going on. The are being rounded up by the , a large group of large men. Yellin stands on a wagon in the midst of all the scuffling. (off-screen) The day of the wedding arrived. The Brute Squad had their hands full carrying out Humperdinck's orders. (to an unpleasantlooking assistant) Is everybody out? Almost. There's a Spaniard giving us some trouble. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 79. Well, you give him some trouble. Move! And his wagon starts, and as it does, : drunk as a skunk, sprawled in front of a hovel, a bottle of brandy in one hand, the six-fingered sword in the other. He looks dreadful. Unshaven, puffy-eyed, gaunt. But the way he brandishes the great sword in front of him would give anyone cause for worry. am waiting for you, Vizzini. You told me to go back to the beginning. So have. This is where am, and this is where 'll stay. will not be moved. He takes a long pull from his brandy bottle. He stops as the Assistant Brute comes into view. Ho there. do not budge. Keep your ""Ho there."" He waves his sword dangerously. But the Prince gave orders -- -- So did Vizzini -- when a job went wrong, you went back to the beginning. And this is where we got the job. So it's the beginning, and 'm staying till Vizzini comes. (gesturing off-screen) You! Brute! Come here. -- -- am -- waiting -- for -- Vizzini -- --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 80. (off-screen) You surely are a meanie. feels a hand on his back. huge hand. He compares it to his own smaller hand. Hello. It's you. True! And as the Assistant Brute is just about to club Inigo's brains out, lets fly with a stupendous punch. The Assistant Brute takes the full force of the blow right in the chops. It's like he was shot from a cannon as he careens backwards out of sight across the street. There is a pause. Then a crunching sound, as he clearly has come in contact with something hard and immobile. puts Inigo down. You don't look so good. (after Inigo blasts air in protest) You don't smell so good either. Perhaps not. feel fine. Yeah? And so puts Inigo down. That's when Inigo faints, and as he does, : ' Inigo sits slumped in a chair, while spoons him some stew. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 81. (off-screen) and Inigo were reunited. And as nursed his inebriated friend back to health, he told Inigo of Vizzini's death and the existence of Count Rugen, the sixfingered man. Considering Inigo's lifelong search, he handled the news surprisingly well. And he faints again into his stew. : one filled with steaming water, the other with water clearly of an icy nature. Without a word stuffs Inigo's head into the icy water, then, after a reasonable amount of time, pulls him out, ducks him into the steaming stuff, and, a short time after that, puts him back in the cold again, then back in the hot -- (off-screen) Fezzik took great care in reviving Inigo. (up and going) That's enough. That's enough! Where is this Rugen so may kill him? He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men. How many could you handle? don't think more than ten. (doing the math on his fingers) That leaves twenty for me. At my best, could never defeat that many. (he sinks sadly down) need Vizzini to plan. have no gift for strategy. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 82. But Vizzini's dead. : Silent and bereft. Then a wild look hits Inigo. No -- not Vizzini -- need the Man in Black -- -- what? -- -- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go -- -- where? To find the Man in Black, obviously. But you don't know where he is. (he is possessed by demons now) Don't bother me with trifles; after twenty years, at last, my father's soul will be at peace. : - (big) There will be blood tonight!! : --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 83. ' -- strewn with maps, etc. Yellin enters, and kneels. (sharpening his dagger) Rise and report. The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate. Double it. My Princess must be safe. The gate has but one key, and carry that. He shows the key, dangling from a chain around his neck. Just at that moment, Buttercup enters. Ah! My dulcet darling. Tonight we marry. Tomorrow morning, your men will escort us to Florin Channel where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our honeymoon. Every ship but your four fastest, you mean. The Prince looks at her blankly for a moment. Every ship but the four you sent. Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four. (bows, exits) Your Majesties. : staring at Humperdinck. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 84. You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway. (sharply) You're a silly girl. Yes, am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear. (close to erupting; speaks very distinctly) -would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you- Why not? You can't hurt me. Westley and are joined by the bonds of love. And you cannot track that. Not with a thousand bloodhounds. And you cannot break it. Not with a thousand swords. And when say you are a coward, that is only because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth. : jumping at her, yanking her by the hair, starting to pull her along, out of control, his words indistinct. ! : as the Prince throws open the door to Buttercup's room, slams it shut, locks it, breaks into a wild run and -- : --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 85. but it's not on. Count Rugen is adding more notes to his book. He looks up as the Prince suddenly comes down the steps, raging. (at Westley) You truly love each other, and so you might have been truly happy. Not one couple in a century has that chance, no matter what the storybooks say. And so think no man in a century will suffer as greatly as you will. And with that he whirls, turns on The Machine, grabs the lever and -- : calling out -- Not to fifty!!! But it's too late as we -- : shoving the lever all the way up and : ' And there has never been such pain. The pain grows and grows and with it now, something else has started . As The Death Scream starts to rise -- : as the moves along, , and -- : --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 86. and they bear it, and a few of the Brutes turn to each other in fear, and as the scream builds -- : and she hears the , doesn't know what it is, but her arms involuntarily go around her body to try to control the trembling, and the scream, still builds and -- : There are many --it is the day of the country's 500th Anniversary -- but all the People stop as the sound hits them. few pale, bolt toward their and -- : trying to make their way through the jammed marketplace, which suddenly quiets as the fading sound comes through. (instantly) , , listen, do you hear? -- That is the sound of ultimate suffering. My heart made that sound when Rugen slaughtered my father. The Man in Black makes it now. The Man in Black? His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering? (trying to push through) Excuse me -- It's too crowded. -- pardon me, it's important -- No one budges and the sound is fading faster. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 87. -- Fezzik, please -- (gigantic and roaring) Everybody ... !! And the Crowd begins to fall away, and he and Inigo start to track the . Thank you. : The Albino appears wheeling a barrow. Inigo's sword pushes at his chest. Where is the Man in Black? The Albino shakes his head, says nothing. You get there from this grove, yes? Silence. Fezzik, jog his memory. And Fezzik crunches the Albino on the top of the head as if he had a hammer and was driving in a nail. The Albino drops without a sound. (upset) 'm sorry, Inigo. didn't mean to jog him so hard. Inigo? : He kneels, the sword held tight between his hands. Eyes closed, he faces the grove of trees, starts to talk, his voice low and strange. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 88. Father, have failed you for twenty years. Now our misery can end. Somewhere ... somewhere close by is a man who can help us. cannot find him alone. need you. need you to guide my sword. Please. And now he rises, eyes still closed. Guide my sword. : as Inigo, eyes shut tight, walks forward, the great sword held in his hands. Fezzik, frightened, follows close behind. : that reveals the staircase. : walking blind through the grove of trees. He moves to the Secret Knot, hesitates, then moves past it. Then Inigo stops. For a long moment he stands frozen. Suddenly he whirls, eyes still closed, and the sword strikes home dead center into a knot and -- Nothing. He has failed. In utter despair he collapses against the tree. Against a knot in the tree. Against in the tree. It slides away, revealing the staircase. and Inigo look at each other, then start down. : dead by The Machine. leans over him, listening for a heartbeat. Then he looks at Inigo, shakes his head. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 89. He's dead. Inigo is in despair. For a moment, he just sags. (barely able to speak) It just is not fair. (off-screen) -- Grandpa, Grandpa -- wait -- : ' He is terribly excited and looks stronger than we've yet seen him. -- wait -- what did mean, ""He's dead?"" mean he didn't mean dead. The Grandfather says nothing, just sits there. Westley's only faking, right? You want me to read this or not? : : Who gets Humperdinck? don't understand. Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who? Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 90. You mean he wins? Jesus, Grandpa! What did you read me this thing for? And he desperately fights for control. You know, you've been very sick and you're taking this story very seriously. think we better stop now. He closes the book and starts to get up. (shaking his head) No! 'm okay. 'm okay. (gestures toward the chair) -- sit down. All right? Okay. (sitting and opening the book again) All right, now, let's see. Where were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of Despair. : , We're back in the Pit, the same shot as before. For a moment, he just sags. Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body. The body? (not stopping) Have you any money? have a little. just hope it's enough to buy a miracle, that's all. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 91. As Fezzik takes the corpse, follows Inigo up the stairs -- : - Inigo, , Westley approach the door. They knock. From inside the hovel a little man's voice is heard. If Mel Brooks' Year Old Man was really old, he'd resemble this guy. (off-screen) Go away! Inigo pounds again. (opening a small window in the door) What? What? Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years? The King's stinking son fired me. And thank you so much for bringing up such a painful subject. While you're at it, why don't you give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it? We're closed! He shuts the window. They rap on the door. (opening the window) Beat it or 'll call the Brute Squad. 'm on the Brute Squad. (looking at the Giant) You are the Brute Squad. We need a miracle. It's very important. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 92. Look, 'm retired. And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired? might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle. He's already dead. (for the first time, interested) He is, eh? 'll take a look. Bring him in. He unlocks the door and lets them in. : hurrying inside. carries Westley who is just starting to stiffen up a little. He lays Westley down across a bench by the fireplace, picks Westley's arm up and lets it drop limp. 've seen worse. He studies Westley a moment, checking here, checking there. Sir. Sir. Hah? We're really in a terrible rush. (He takes nothing from nobody) Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money? Sixty-five. Sheesh! never worked for so little, except once, and that was a very noble cause. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 93. This is noble, sir. (pointing to Westley, remorseful) His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation. Are you a rotten liar. need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years. Your first story was better. (looking around) Where's that bellows? (spots it) He probably owes you money, huh? Well, 'll ask him. He goes to get a huge bellows. (stupefied) He's dead. He can't talk. Look who knows so much. Well, it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Please open his mouth. Inigo does. Max inserts the bellows in Westley's mouth and starts to pump. Now, mostly dead is slightly alive. Now, all dead...well, with all dead, there's usually only one thing that you can do. What's that? He stops pumping. Go through his clothes and look for loose change. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 94. He starts pumping again. (to Westley) Hey! Hello in there. Hey! What's so important? What you got here that's worth living for? And he presses lightly on Westley's chest. ... tr ... oooo .... luv... Everybody stares at Westley lying there on the bench. True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that. Sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world. Except for a nice , a mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe. They're so perky, love that. But that's not what he said. He distinctly said ""to blave."" And, as we all know, ""to blave"" means ""to bluff."" So you're probably playing cards, and he cheated ' -- Liar -- ---- -- , an ancient fury, storms out of a back room and toward -- get back, witch -- 'm not a witch, 'm your wife. But after what you just said, 'm not even sure want to be that anymore. You never had it so good. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 95. ""True love."" He said, ""true love,"" Max. My God -- (retreating) Don't say another word, Valerie. (turning to Inigo and Fezzik) He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered. Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name -- (pursuing him now) What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck. Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck (holding his hands over his ears) 'm not listening. life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help -- Nobody's hearing nothing! Humperdinck. Humperdinck! Humperdinck! -- But this is Buttercup's true love -- If you heal him, he will stop Humperdinck's wedding. Humperdinck. Humperdinck -- (to Valerie) Shut up -- (now to Inigo) Wait. Wait. make him better, Humperdinck suffers? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 96. Humiliations galore! That is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, 'm on the job. And as Valerie shrieks excitedly we : It is somewhat smaller than a tennis ball. , exhausted, looking at the lump with beautific pleasure, as Valerie, cooking utensil in hand, covers the thing with what looks like chocolate. Inigo and stare at the thing too, but more dubiously. (a little appalled) That's a miracle pill? Max nods. (finishing) The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what? An hour. Yeah, an hour. good hour. Yeah. Inigo accepts the pill as takes Westley, who is stiff as a board now. (heading out the door, Fezzik close behind) Thank you for everything. Okay. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 97. (waving after them) Bye-bye, boys. Have fun storming the castle. (to Max) Think it'll work? It would take a miracle. Bye! Bye. And as they wave, trying to look happy we -- : , , on the top of the outer wall of the castle. They look down to the front gate of the castle. The sixty Brutes are visible. is thunderstruck by how many Brutes there are. Upset, he turns to Inigo, who is concentrating unsuccessfully, trying to prop Westley against the wall. Inigo -- there's more than thirty -- (absolutely unfazed) What's the difference? (indicating the half- dead Westley) We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him. Has it been fifteen minutes? We can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand. During this, , using all his strength, has managed to get Westley into a right angled sitting position, while Inigo brings out the miracle pill. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 98. Tilt his head back. Open his mouth. (following orders) How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works? : Pill in hand, he drops it into Westley's mouth. Your guess is as good as mine -- (frantic) 'll beat you both apart. 'll take you both together. Guess not very long. Inigo and react. Westley is the only one not amazed. Why won't my arms move? He sits there, immobile, like a ventriloquist's dummy. You've been mostly dead all day. We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back. Who are you? -- Are we enemies? Why am on this wall? -- Where's Buttercup? -- Let me explain -- (pauses very briefly) -- No, there is too much. Let me sum up. () --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 99. (') Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after kill Count Rugen. That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying. He is watching his fingers, one of which twitches now. You've just wiggled your finger. That's wonderful. 've always been a quick healer. (to Inigo) What are our liabilities? There is but one working castle gate. Fezzik helps Inigo raise Westley just high enough so he can see for himself. And it is guarded by sixty men. And our assets? Your brains, Fezzik's strength, my steel. : absolutely stunned. That's it? Impossible. If had a month to plan, maybe could come up with something. But this... He shakes his head from side to side. : --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 100. (trying to be cheery) You just shook your head -- that doesn't make you happy? My brains, his steel, and your strength against sixty men, and you think a little head jiggle is supposed to make me happy? mean, if we only had a wheelbarrow, that would be something. Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had? Over the Albino, think. Well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place? What wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak. There we cannot help you. (pulling one out) Will this do? (to Fezzik-- surprised) Where did you get that? At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice, he said could keep it. All right, all right. Come on, help me up. Inigo and Fezzik do. Now, 'll need a sword eventually. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 101. Why? You can't even lift one. True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it? (And his bead tilts limply back. Fezzik sets it up right for him) Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside. 'll say -- how do find the Count? -- Once do, how do find you again? -- Once find you again, how do we escape? -- (sharply) Don't pester him, he's had a hard day. (nods) Right, right, sorry. : They move along the wall in silence for a time. Then these words come to us on the wind -- Inigo. What? hope we win... : in her bridal gown, and she's incredible. It's not just her beauty; there's a tranquillity about her now. The Prince, fastening a pearl necklace around her. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 102. You don't seem excited, my little muffin. Should be? Brides often are, 'm told. (gently, confidently) do not marry tonight. : and she couldn't seem more serene. My Westley will save me. : looking down on the gate with Inigo and Fezzik. : -- and Yellin, standing there, flanked by his sixty Brutes. : looking out at the enemy. This is it. Inigo and shake hands. Westley can't even do that, but after a bit of rocking back and forth, he manages to get enough momentum to catapult his arm over and onto his friend's. : - The most intelligent looking, the most impressive appearing imaginable. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 103. Buttercup and Humperdinck kneel before the Clergyman. Behind them sit the mumbling old . Standing in the back is Count Rugen. are in position flanking the chapel door. (clears his throat, begins to speak) Mawidge...mawidge is what bwings us togewer today... He has an impediment that would stop a clock. Mawidge, the bwessed awwangement, that dweam wiffim a dweam... And now, from outside the castle, there begins to come a commotion. And then-- (off-screen) Stand your ground, men. Stand your ground. : by the gate, for it is indeed they who are making the commotion, frightened, pointing. Stand your ground. : ...: And it is a bit unnerving -- a seems to be floating toward them out of the darkness, a Giant in a strange cloak, and with a voice that would crumble walls. (deep and booming) . . : --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 104. and he seems to be floating because he's standing in the wheelbarrow, as Inigo, hidden behind him, busts a gut by pushing it and supporting Westley.

Oh, you mean this gate key. And he whips it out, hands it to Fezzik. : And do you, Pwincess Buwwercwup... Man and wife -- say man and wife... Man and wife. (whirling to the King and Queen) Escort the bride to the Honeymoon Suite -- 'll be there shortly. And as he dashes off -- : standing there. Dazed. He didn't come. : racing through the castle, and as they reach a complex intersection of several corridors, Rugen stops, incredulous, as we : , , moving toward them. Actually Fezzik is dragging Westley, who is, in turn, dragging Yellin's sword like a stiff dog leash --Westley simply hasn't the strength to raise it. : --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 108. as the confrontation is about to start. Kill the dark one and the giant, but leave the third for questioning. And as his Warriors attack -- Inigo goes wild, and maybe the Warrior's are good, maybe they're even better than that -- but they never get a chance to show it because this is something now, this is Inigo gone mad and the six-fingered sword has never flashed faster and the is dead before the has even hit the floor. There is a pause. Then -- (to Rugen, evenly and soft) Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die. : For a moment he just stands there, sword in hand. Then he does a most unexpected thing. He turns and runs the hell away. : momentarily surprised, then taking off after him, leaving Westley and Fezzik to exchange curious looks and Rugen, running through a half-open heavy wooden door, shutting it and locking it just as Inigo throws himself against it. He tries again. No kind of chance. (calling out) Fezzik, need you -- : who is still unable to walk under his own power. He calls back -- --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 109. (indicating Westley) can't leave him alone. : desperately pounding at the heavy door. He's getting away from me, Fezzik. Please. ! : (to Westley) 'll be right back. And he props Westley up against a large suit of armor and takes off toward the intersection where Inigo's voice came from -- : still hammering the door. Fezzik approaches, gestures for him to stop, and with one mighty swipe of his mighty hands the door crumbles Thank you -- And Inigo flies through as Fezzik heads back to Westley. : The Queen, more sprightly, is several paces ahead. (can hardly be understood) Strange wedding. Yes. very strange wedding. Come along. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 110. Buttercup gently stops the King and places a kiss on his forehead. He's very surprised and pleased. What was that for? Because you've always been so kind to me. And won't be seeing you again since 'm killing myself once we reach the Honeymoon Suite. (smiling away --his hearing isn't what it once was) Won't that be nice? (calling out to the Queen) She kissed me... And on those words -- : And he's running, dashing through corridors and as he glances back -- : behind him, coming like a streak and -- : with the large suit of armor, and Fezzik gaping, staring at all those choices, trying to piece together the puzzle of the missing Westley. : flashing out of one room, down a staircase, picking up his pace. He pulls out a deadly looking dagger, with a sharp point and a triangular shaped blade, and sprints on and -- : --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 111. closing the gap, closer, closer and he's down the stairs and heading into a dining hall and -- : throwing the dagger -- : trying like hell to get out of the way, but no, and it sticks deep into his stomach, and he hurtles back helplessly against the wall of the room, his eyes glazed, blood coming from his wound. The room is going white on him. ... Sorry, Father ... tried ... tried... : looking across the room at Inigo. He stares at Inigo's face, and then touches his own cheeks, as memory comes. You must be that little Spanish brat taught a lesson to all those years ago. It's simply incredible. Have you been chasing me your whole life only to fail now? think that's the worst thing ever heard. How marvelous. Inigo sinks. : shutting the door of the Honeymoon Suite, crossing quietly to the far wall where she sits at a table, opens a jeweled box, and takes out a very deadly looking dagger. She seems very much at peace as she touches the knife to her bosom. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 112. There's a shortage of perfect breasts in this world. It would be a pity to damage yours. And Buttercup whirls as we -- : lying on the bed. Yellin's sword is beside him. His voice sounds just fine, but he does not move. Buttercup leaps to the bed, covering him with kisses. Westley is helpless. Oh, Westley, darling. (more kisses) Westley, why won't you hold me? (gently) Gently. At a time like this that's all you can think to say? ""Gently?"" (not so gently) Gently!! And she lets go, thumping his head against the headboard and : looking very much surprised. Good heavens. Are you still trying to win? Inigo, struggling feebly, pulling the dagger from his stomach. Holding the wound with his left hand. Rugen is pushing off from the table, sword in hand, moving in to kill Inigo. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 113. You've got an overdeveloped sense of vengeance. It's going to get you into trouble some day. Inigo watches the Count approach, and the Count flicks his sword at Inigo's heart, and there's not much Inigo can do, just kind of vaguely parry the thrust with the six-fingered sword and Count Rugen's blade sinks deeply into Inigo's left shoulder. Inigo doesn't seem to feel it, his other agonies are so much worse. : stepping back, going for the heart again. : And as this blow comes he's trying to use the wall for support in forcing himself to his feet, and it's not a roaring success of an attempt, but he does at least make some progress, and again he manages to parry the thrust, as this time Rugen's sword runs through his right arm. Again, Inigo doesn't seem to mind, doesn't even feel it. : stepping back forj ust a moment, watching as Inigo continues to inch his way to his feet and then, just before the Count is about to strike again, Inigo manages a little flick of his own and Rugen hadn't expected it, and he jumps back, makes a little involuntary cry of surprise and : slowly pushing away from the wall. (all but audible) Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father; prepare to die. : --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 114. suddenly going into a fierce attack, striking with great power and precision for he is a master swordsman, and he forces Inigo easily back, drives him easily into the wall. But he does not penetrate Inigo's defense. None of the Count's blows get home. As the Count steps back a moment -- : pushing slowly off from the wall again. (a little louder) Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die. : And again he attacks, slashing with wondrous skill. But none of his blows get through and, slowly, Inigo, again moves forward. (a little louder still) Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die. Stop saying that! : retreating more quickly around the table. Inigo drives for the Count's left shoulder now, thrusts home where the Count had gotten him. Then another move and his blade enters the Count's right shoulder, the same spot Inigo was wounded. (all he's got) ! . . . --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 115. No -- -- offer me money -- And now the six-fingered sword strikes and there is a slash bleeding along one of Rugen's cheeks. -- yes -- -- power too -- promise me that -- The great sword flashes again, and now there is a parallel slash bleeding on Rugen's other cheek. -- all that have and more please -- -- offer me everything ask for -- -- anything you want -- (roaring) , - -! And on that -- : and almost too fast for the eye to follow, the sword strikes one final time and -- : crying out in fear and panic as the sword hits home dead center and -- : --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 116. the sword clear through the Count. They are almost frozen like that for a moment. Then Inigo withdraws his sword and as the Count pitches down -- : lying dead. His skin is ashen and the blood still pours from the parallel cuts on his cheeks and his eyes are bulging wide, full of fear. : staring at Rugen. And now Inigo does something we have never seen him do before: he smiles. on Inigo smiling, then -- : lies as before, not a muscle has moved, his head is still on the headboard, Yellin's sword at his side. Buttercup is alongside the bed; her eyes never leave his face. Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me? What hideous sin have you committed lately? got married. didn't want to. It all happened so fast. It never happened. What? It never happened. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 117. But it did. was there. This old man said, ""Man and wife."" Did you say, "" do""? Well, no, we sort of skipped that part. Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it (a pause) -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness? : entering the room, staring at them. He pulls out his sword. technicality that will shortly be remedied. But first things first. To the death. No. (a little pause) To the pain. (about to charge, stops short) don't think 'm quite familiar with that phrase. 'll explain. And 'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon. That may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me. : --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 118. lying there comfortably, his words quiet at first. It won't be the last. To the pain means the first thing you lose will be your feet, below the ankles, then your hands at the wrists, next your nose. : gripping his sword, watching. -- and then my tongue, suppose. killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake don't mean to duplicate tonight. wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right -- (takes step forward) -- and then my ears, understand. Let's get on with it : : Wrong! Your ears you keep, and 'll tell you why -- : And now he stops, and the look that was in his eyes at the wedding, that look of fear, is starting to return. -- so that every shriek of every child at seeing your hideousness will be yours to cherish -- every babe that weeps at your approach, every woman who cries out, ""Dear God, what is that thing?"" will echo in your perfect ears. () --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 119. (') That is what ""to the pain"" means. It means leave you in anguish, wallowing in freakish misery forever. : doing his best to hide the fear that keeps building inside him. think you're bluffing -- : lying there, staring at him. It's possible, pig -- might be bluffing -- it's conceivable, you miserable vomitous mass, that 'm only lying here because lack the strength to stand -- then again, perhaps have the strength after all. And now, slowly, Westley begins to move. His body turns, his feet go to the floor, he starts to stand -- : staring, eyes wide. : And now he is standing, sword in fighting position. (slow and determined) --. : --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 120. and he's so panicked he doesn't know whether to pee or wind his watch. He throws his sword to the floor. (to Humperdinck) Have a seat. : speaking to Buttercup as Humperdinck sits. Tie him up. Make it as tight as you like. And as she sets to work -- : entering, looking around. Where's Fezzik? thought he was with you. No. In that case -- his balance betrays him. (to Buttercup) Help him. Why does Westley need helping? Because he has no strength -- : --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 121. and now be starts wrestling mightily with his bonds. knew it! knew you were bluffing! knew he was bluffing. (staring at the Prince) Shall dispatch him for you? (considers this, then) Thank you, but no -- whatever happens to us, want him to live a long life alone with his cowardice. (off-screen) Inigo! Inigo, where are you? They look at each other, then move to the balcony, and : leading . He glances up, sees them on the balcony. Ah, there you are. Inigo, saw the Prince's stables, and there they were, four white horses. And thought, there are four of us, if we ever find the lad -- hello, lad -- so took them with me, in case we ever bumped into each other. (considers things a moment) guess we just did. : looking down at . , you did something right. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 122. Don't worry -- won't let it go to my head. And as he holds out his great arms-- : : Buttercup floating through the air. What's happening, of course, is that she's jumping from the balcony so Fezzik can catch her. But her fall is in slow motion so you might think she was flying. Westley and Inigo, watching as catches Buttercup. You know, it's very strange -- have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over, don't know what to do with the rest of my life. (as Inigo gets him ready for his jump) Have you ever considered piracy? You'd make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts. Now from that -- : triumphantly racing through the night -- : and at last their trials are done. They stop. (off-screen) They rode to freedom. And as dawn arose, Westley and Buttercup knew they were safe. wave of love swept over them. And as they reached for each other... --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 123. As Buttercup and Westley begin their ultimate kiss -- : ' The Grandfather stops reading. What? What? No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it. don't mind so much. He gestures for his Grandfather to read. Okay. : locked in a deep, pure and passionate kiss. (off-screen) Since the invention of the kiss, there have been five kisses that were rated the most passionate, the most pure. This one left them all behind. The end. : ' The Grandfather snaps the book closed. Now think you ought to go to sleep. Okay. (standing, readying to leave) Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So long. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 124. Grandpa? The Old Man stops, turns. Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.

Vince is not unhappy at this information. But instead of just one perfect kid, Mom had two of us -- way to go, Mom. Wrong. The embryo split in two, but it didn't split equally. All * the purity and strength went into Julius. All the crap that was left over went into what you see in the mirror every morning. (stunned) Whoa -- 'm the crap? It's not true, Vince. No, want to hear this. (to Traven) 'm left-over crap? 'm no good? He's wrong. Angry tears well up in Vince's eyes. Just look at him -- You tellin' me 'm a side effect!?!

And remember, was taken to a beautiful island, protected, educated, loved, given every opportunity to grow, to dream, to create. But you had none of that. Vince remembers. All the bravado about loving being an orphan has gone now. You had nobody. Nobody to love you, nobody to trust you, nobody to encourage you. All life taught you was that the only person you could count on was yourself. Tears begin to well up in Vince's eyes.

Do look okay? You look better, put it that way. We got to do something about the way you walk. You're moving a tad stiff, Jules. Ever see * Frankenstein? read the book. That's not gonna help. You got to walk like you're moving in time to music.

Julius hangs back; something is bothering him. * (embarrassed; a burst) Vince, you've got to help me -- 've never been out on a date before... what should do?

Okay, come here, put your feet by my feet -- (coming over) -- Thank you for this, Vince -- (a pained look on his face) -- said put your feet by my feet not on my feet! -- Julius looks at his brother, then self-consciously takes his hands.

' - A137 Vince, Linda, Julius and Marnie are seated at a table covered with quite a few empty beer bottles. They are all a little drunk. Did you know they had beer in ancient Egypt? Er... no... Actually it was invented by the Assyrians, but the Eygptians were the first people to perfect the malt fermentation process. You sure know a lot about beer. He knows a lot about everything. Julius polishes off the bottle, belches. () )( - Rev. 6/16/88 103. * A137 : A137 But it's all from books. Until tonight never had a beer. All theory, no practice -- the story of my life! Well, we're going to change all that -- aren't we, Marnie? Julius, embarrassed, looks over at Marnie, who's smiling sweetly at him. Can ask you a question? Anything... Am shit-faced yet? Linda, surprised, does a spit-take with her beer. (laughing) You're getting there. Vince gets to his feet. Please excuse me -- my back teeth are floating. Vince exits.

Were you nervous? was twelve and she was a nun -- that's real pressure. They both finish at the urinals and begin washing at the sink. got to admit it, Jules -- since met you, life is getting better all the time. Julius, a little smashed, can't hide his feelings. He grips Vince by the shoulders. For me, too, Vince! Sometimes 'm so happy, want to pick you up and hug you! Julius starts to do so, just as another man enters. Hey, cut it out! Not in here!

Linda suddenly freezes at the sight of Morris Klane scoping the room. Morris is still wearing a bandage from his beating by Julius. Did you tell anybody we were coming to Santa Fe? (unconcerned) Well, phoned work and told them we wouldn't be coming in for a few days... Oh, forgot to tell you -- we've been fired. (tight-lipped) Let's go to the ladies' room. But we just went. Linda takes Marnie by the hand, just as -- each with a cast on his foot, each supported by a crutch, force them back into the booth. Hello, girls -- Do you mind if we sit down and enjoy the music with you? : approach the table. Burt and Bob open their jackets, revealing they have guns on the girls. Morris Klane appears behind Vince and Julius. This has gone way past a simple case of loan deliquency. We don't like getting shot. * What are you talking about? We didn't shoot anybody.

Morris grabs Vince roughly by the arm. Let's go. (ominous) Don't touch him. (suddenly rough) * This is not your problem -- you * don't want me to hurt these lovely ladies, do you? He pushes his gun into Marnie's side. (cries out) -- Ow! You moved too soon... What? The second rule in a crisis situation: (wary) He's starting that funny talk again...

This is no bluff -- Asshole -- Burt gives a small head signal and two very large men stand up from a nearby table. They each grab one of Julius's arms. Meet my cousins. (to the Klanes) Get these jerks outside. Just then, so sudden and quick that it's over as soon as it begins, Julius double kicks the seated Burt and Bob in the head. They're out cold before they realize they've been attacked. Without stopping, Julius whips his arms together in front of him bringing Sam and Dave into painful contact with each others' head. They, too, are now out cold. Vince uses this opportunity to stomp, with all his might, on the toe of Morris who's busy watching Julius dismantle his relatives. Morris screams and lets go of Vince, who runs to the nearby pool table, grabs a cue and slams it over the head of the now hobbling Morris. All five Klanes are out cold. How many of those... rules do you have? Quite a few.

Vince watches him, glances at his watch, and begins to edge towards the door. Uh... we got cable , a fully stocked bar, free ice -- we're in great shape. Where you going? thought 'd just go and tuck Linda in for the night. Vince picks up one of Julius' heavy tomes. Maybe read her a bedtime story. (with a wink) Don't wait up for me. Julius looks fondly at his brother as he sees him to the door. What a day, Vincent, we visited our birth place. We bought new clothes. We danced the waltz. We get into a fight -- We've got this great room. (heart-felt) It just doesn't get any better than this. Vince gives Julius a sly look as he lets himself out of the room.

Watched by Julius, Marnie pulls the curtains shut, kills the overhead lights, all the while providing him with glimpses of various parts of her anatomy. She gets into one of the beds, turns off the bedside lamp. Good night. Good night. Julius puts the blanket and pillow from the other bed onto the floor between the two beds, then shuts off the other lamp. Silence... This mattress is awful. Getting out of bed, she pulls the blanket and pillow with her as she steps over Julius, who tries not to look up, and gets into the other bed. Sorry. Good night. Good night. Silence... This mattress is just as bad as the other one. She gets out, again dragging the blanket and pillow, puts them down on the floor next to Julius. She crawls under the blanket, turns her back to him.

She starts to roll over Julius, then pauses directly above him and looks him dead in the eye. Can ask you something for a change? Anything. Do you like me? mean, even a little bit? ...

It's very beautiful, isn't it, Vince? Not to mention valuable -- real estate like this must be worth a fortune. (a rebuke) You mustn't always think of money.

She's in work clothes, smudged, hair in a bandana. Maybe 60, there's something terribly appealing about her. She's her own woman. She gets up from her knees now as they approach -- but not before we note the quality of her gardening -- it's the size Julius had back on the island. Should you be here?

The Gardener ushers them towards a door in the garden wall. She opens it, politely stands back, letting them go through it. They turn back to look at her. Mary Anne Benedict never understood why people wanted to buy her paintings. But for a brief period they were considered valuable. She used the money to buy Whispering Pines so that young artists would have a place to work. () - Rev. 4/22/88 121. * C149 : (3) C149 She's not famous anymore? She never wanted to be famous.

Not smiling. 				 		Why do the workers look unhappy? 				 		Because they are here. 			(beat) 		Because Tsavo is the worst place in 		the world. 			(He points ahead) 		Come, John- to the bridge. 			(And on that-) as the camera pans along. in the distance as they walk toward it. And here is as good a place as any to explain just what the spot where the movie takes place was like. There were five hundred men working for Patterson. And they lived in a spread out area. bunch of Indian coolies who might have come from the same town back in their country might choose to live in one cluster of tents. group of natives might be in another cluster. What we have then, as far as living places are concerned, are dozens of clusters of tents. (Eventually, as the terror began, these areas all got surrounded, each with its own thorn fence.) The places we'll come to know best are, among others, Patterson's living area, the hospital tent area, the area by the river where the bridge is to be built, etc., etc. As they move, Samuel points out various camps. is getting ready for prayer. is eating. are cleaning their tent area. Anyway, you get the idea. Just remember that the place covered a wide expanse, maybe a mile square, maybe more. Okay, back to the story. 				 			(as they pass the 			tent area where prayer is 			starting) 		It's all wonderfully under control, 		Samuel- you've done a splendid job. 				 		Thank you. The truth is this: you 		have to work at it constantly. 				 		The workers don't get on? 				 		Get on? They detest each other. 		Obviously the Africans hate the 		Indians. But the Indians also hate 		the other Indians. Some of them 		worship cows, while others eat them. 			(As they move on) . . And suddenly the track just stops in mid-air as we standing high above the Tsavo River. The track has come to the edge of the area above the riverbank- where it just stops- -and picks up on the far side. All that's missing, in other words, is the hundred-yard-long bridge that will connect the pieces of track. 				 			(to the far side) 		Railhead is across there. . Nothing can be made out clearly but there are great clouds of dust. 				 		Three thousand men laying track- when 		the bridge is done, it all joins up. Patterson nods, says nothing, but goes to his haunches, staring at the space where the bridge is to be. 				 		Did it look like this in your mind? 				 			(shakes his head) 		This is more difficult- . . Excited. 				 			(eyes bright) 		-but how wonderful that it's 		difficult, it should be difficult- 		what better job in all the world 		than build a bridge?- make things 		connect- bring worlds together- and 		get it right! 			(Now from Patterson-) as Patterson and Samuel walk in. Patterson glances around- -it's not bad at all. Of course there are some patients, injured or with fever. But like the rest of the camp we've just seen, everything is working well, everything is under control. Starling approaches. 				 		Finish your tour? 				 			(nods) 		And anxious to get started. 			(indicating the hospital) 		What is this, mostly malaria? 				 		Yes- but their suffering is only 		transitory- once they except God 		into their hearts, He will vanquish 		all pain. 				' (over) 		That's just vomitous talk, Nigel- the 		poor bastards will relapse if you keep 		on that way. 			(As they turn-) . tough, middle-aged cockney. And a heavy drinker. man who hasn't been tactful in twenty years. 				 			(to Patterson) 		'm David Hawthorne, this is my 		hospital. And my advice to you is, 		""don't get sick in front of it."" 			(beat) 		That was meant to be charming, 		sorry. seem to have lost the knack. 				 		You never had it. 				 		Nigel and don't like each other much. 				 			(breaking the tension) 		 am also liaison between these two. 				 			(to Hawthorne) 		Clearly you don't agree about building 		the railroad? 				 		This sham? Ridiculous. Who needs it? 		It's only being built to control the 		ivory trade, make men richer. 				 		Then why do you stay? 				 		Who else would hire me? 			(to Starling) 		Beat you to it, didn't ? 			(beat) 		Oh yes, almost forgot- brought you a 		little welcoming gift. 			(Now he gestures and we-) who approaches them. He has been freshly bandaged across one shoulder. 				 		This is Karim, one of my orderlies- 		attacked by a man-eater earlier 		today- first incident of that kind 		here. Patterson says not a word, just studies the wounded man. 				 			(incredulous) 		 man-eater attacks and you're such 		a buffoon you almost forget to mention 		it? 				 		Well, he got away, didn't he? 			(to Patterson) 		Riding a donkey not far from here 		when the lion sprang on them- donkey 		took the brunt of it- then suddenly 		the lion ran off. . Listening. No emotion on his face. . He's kind of enjoying this. Bearing down. 				 		 know it's your first day and of 		course you must be tired from the 		journey- 			(beat) 		-but what are you going to do about 		it? 				 			(a long pause, then evenly-) 		Karim will have to show me where it 		happened. And of course, 'll need 		the donkey. 			(beat) 		With any luck, 'll sort it out tonight. 			(And he walks out, leaving 			an astonished Starling 			staring after him) ' Starling has a tent there, too, as do Samuel and Hawthorne. And there are half a dozen . Right now, Patterson is unpacking, moving in and out of his tent. Starling, sipping tea, sits and watches. 				 		 couldn't believe it when you said 		""sort it out."" As if it were the most 		normal thing in the world. ""Ho-hum, 		what lovely tea, think 'll bag a 		killer beast this evening, nothing 		much else going on anyway."" 				 		Well, he put me in a spot, didn't he? 		But that's all right- after all, 'm 		responsible for everything that happens 		here. And it certainly won't do much 		for morale if a man-eater's on the prowl. He goes into his tent with some books now and we go with him. There is a photo of Helena on a small table. photo of an , clearly his parents. His clothes are stacked with precision. He arranges his books precisely too. Clearly, John Patterson is a man who believes in order. 				 			(calling out) 		You said ""of course"" you'd need the 		donkey. Why ""of course""? 				 			(taking a rifle, 			moving outside) 		We know three things about man-eaters. 		First, they always return to where 		they've attacked before. Second, they're 		always old- they can't catch other 		animals so they turn to us. And third, 		they're always alone- they've been cast 		out by their pride because they can't 		keep up. , sipping his tea and there's no hiding it, he's excited. But also a bit reluctant. 				 		 don't suppose could watch. 				 			(delighted) 		Might be exciting for you. 				 		've never been all that adventurous. 		 wouldn't be in the way? 				 		'd love the company. And 've hunted 		all my life. 				 			(gathering courage) 		Well, why not? You seem so calm and 		experienced. 			(standing, teacup in hand) 		Why not, indeed! 			(Now from that-) It's roped loosely to a tree, bells around its neck. When it moves, they make a sound. Middle of the night. night wind. We're in a clearing with thick trees all around. , seated uncomfortably in a tree on the edge of the clearing, twelve feet up in the air. Patterson has his rifle ready. This next is all whispered. 				 			(embarrassed) 		 hate to be a bother, John, but the 		cramp's getting worse. 			(Pulls up his trousers- 			his leg is knotted) 		The pain is actually quite unbearable 		now. 				 		Shhh. 				 		'm sure you mean that to be comforting, 		but- 				 			(interrupting) 		-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel. 				 		That is precisely my plan- but back in 		my tent. 			(And he begins to climb down) , grabbing him. 				 		They own the night- nobody moves when 		there's a man-eater out there. Starling glumly obeys. Then- 				 		John? know this isn't the time to ask, 		but- 				 		What? 				 		Since you'd only been here three hours 		when we met, are you sure this is how 		you hunt lions? 				 		Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse 		than you think- 've never even seen one. , not pleased with this news. He massages his calf, tries to get comfortable, which is impossible. Patterson just stares at the night. The donkey dozes. So does Starling. Patterson has not so much as moved. Now the bushes behind the donkey shake just a little. And the donkey is suddenly awake and scared- -and then it all goes crazy- the donkey screams and a lion appears from the bushes and Patterson fires one shot and the sound - -and Starling topples from the tree to the ground, landing shocked but unhurt- -he has landed close to the dead lion- he stares at it. 				 			(amazed) 		...one shot... 				 			(even more amazed) 		So that's what a lion looks like. 			(Now from the tree-) - for a moment. 				 (over) 		One shot- one- Now Samuel comes walking into the shot, really excited- -it's the first time we've seen his wonderful smile. 				 		Patterson has made the nights safe 		again. . As he walks on, behind him come carrying the body of the lion. As dozens of men come running in from all over to see the dead man-eater- 				 			(mimes shooting) 		! 			(Now as the crowd 			continues to grow-) ' It has two embankments on either side of the river. These embankments are big- forty feet wide, fifty feet high. standing on the high ground where the embankment will start. From here, there is a slope down to the river itself. Also present is , who we saw earlier standing precariously atop the water tower. Singh, enormously powerful, is another assistant. Bright, a great worker, another main character in what is to follow. Now Patterson starts to walk down the slope towards the river- it's not that easy to do without falling, but that doesn't bother him. He talks and gestures as he explains to the other two who move down with him. Singh, for all his massive size, moves like a cat. Starling does not, slipping and sliding. 				 			(gesturing) 		All right, 'd like to start the 		embankments today- 			(to Singh) 		-sufficient supplies on hand? 				 			(nods) 		More than. 				 		With much more on the way- 			(loses balance, falls) 		-John- we could have had this chat on 		flatter ground- 				 		-true enough- but without the comedy 		relief. 			(Starling, amazingly good 			natured, smiles, gets 			back up) as they scramble down to it. they've come down- it's a long way back to the top. . It's a glorious morning. 				 		How lucky we are. 				 		Aren't we full of ourselves today? 			(beat) 		 think it's because of the lion. 				 		Possibly. 				 			(soft) 		You know, too have killed a lion. 				 		How many shots did you need? . Almost embarrassed. 				 		 used my hands. He holds his big hands up, palms out. Starling looks at Singh to see if he means it- -he means it all right. Now, from Starling's perpetually surprised face- sighting through it- we are on the far side of the river now. Singh is there, Starling, too. Behind them: a field of tall grass. 				 		All right- thee second embankment 		will go there. 			(He gestures toward 			the river) 				 		You do plan to mark it a bit more 		precisely than just- 			(imitating Patterson) 		-""there."" 				 			(smiling) 		In your honor, Nigel. And you and 		Singh will be in charge of building 		them- and you'll also build the 		roadbeds and the three foundation 		pillars- and you'll be finished in 		eight thrilling weeks. 				 			(very dubious) 		John, it will not be easy. 				 		Nigel, you'll just have to use your 		hands- 			(And he smiles, repeating 			Singh's gesture, both 			palms out) . He smiles back, starts to reply. But his words stop, his smile dies. He just stares and we- ' - the surrounding field of tall grass. Nothing unusual about it. . He stares, too. - suddenly it begins to bend and sway in a fresh wind. . Silent. As before. Starling follows his glance. . Frozen. . And now the field is making odd patterns- as if something unseen were moving through. . Quiet. Just the wind. . Nothing visible. But the odd pattern seems to be making its way across the field. . Quiet. Just the wind. . The odd pattern seems to stop. Around it, the wind makes different shapes of the grass. , as the wind continues to blow. He continues to stare at the spot where the pattern stopped. . As before. Except for one thing: suddenly, he begins to shiver, as if from cold. And what we see are a lot of cuts of a lot of activity. Huge wooden logs are carried in and hammered to each other and driven deep into the ground- the framework for the embankments. And Singh carries the heaviest loads and leads the workers- and as the structure rises, he is the one darting along the top, high in the air, pulling more logs up, helping here, helping there. And alongside him is his assistant, , a little man with glasses and very bright eyes. Meanwhile, Starling is leading construction on the embankment that is on the far side of the river. And he does his best, tries to help on the top part as it rises- but alas, he is a bit on the clumsy side and balance is a problem for him. But he stays with it, does well. And Patterson, in tremendous spirits, helps when needed, but mostly he is dealing with other aspects of the bridge- such as the placements of the three stone foundation pillars- -he wades into the water, climbs the structures, takes it all in- and at the start he is still in the uniform he has worn since the start of the story- but it's clumsy for labor- -so he changes halfway through to civilian clothes- -which is all he wears from now on. And the workers tire in the heat- but Singh keeps them going, working with the power of three- -and there are accidents and explosions, injuries and falls- and Hawthorne appears when needed to help with the wounded- -it's hard, brutal work- -but gradually, the wooden structure part is finished- two huge skeletons facing each other across the Tsavo River- and now work on the roadbed is going full blast and in the river, the three foundation pillars are taking shape- - being shoved into the wooden skeleton to complete the embankments. As this goes on- in the river- the foundation pillar work is going very quickly. Patterson stops working, looks across the river- -movement in the grassy area on the far side. as they rise out of the grass, gesture to Samuel who gestures back. The Nandi are a tribe of powerful little men, primitive, with teeth that have been sharpened to points. watching them. 				 		What are they looking at? 				 		You- they cannot believe you're 		still here. 				 		Nonsense. 				 		You don't know what Tsavo means, do 		you? 			(Patterson doesn't) 		It means ""slaughter""... , staring at Patterson, shaking their heads. , as more and more red rock is shoved and pushed into shape. - almost finished. . The same. as still more rock is forced in and done at last- -and Singh stands on the top of the near one while across the river, Patterson pulls Starling to the top of the other. And they all look at each other- the embankments are both finished- are flying- -and what they do is this: hold their hands out toward each other, in Singh's gesture. It's kind of become their password. . big moment for them all! ' He sits around a fire and the man is exhausted. His dinner plate is beside him, untouched. He's too tired to eat. ' Starling is there, getting ready for bed. He's wiped out, too. , going into his tent, lying down, breathing deep. is in his tent, turning out his lamp, half asleep already. in his tent, closing his eyes. , deep asleep in his tent- -he shares it with a dozen others and they're all deep asleep. They lie on the floor of the tent, heads together toward the center pole, feet toward the edges of the tent. . It's very dark. just lie motionless, breathing deeply. . Now the moves up, high into the center of the tent, looking down at the circle of men. . They don't move, not even an inch. The steady breathing is the only sound. , . . Nothing is going on down there. Nothing at all. . Not a goddamn thing. . . And now two things happen at the same time- Singh's eyes go wide- -and he starts to slide out of the tent, as if being pulled by some giant invisible wire- . . Screaming. , waking, staring around and as he slides out of the tent into the night and his screams grow even louder as we and it's like a bomb just went off, they rise, spin, cry out, stare- ' sliding along the ground. It's pitch black, and he's going head first now, face upwards and he's going ast tremendous speed and whatever the hell it is that's making this happen is something we can't make out- because it's so dark and because it's on the far side of the man, and his body is in our way and , some bushes and , his body going faster than before and his cries are weakening- - and his body and there is no sound at all coming from him now and there is no sound from whatever it is that is making this happen- all we see, barely, is the limp body of the big man as it skims along and- , a low clump of bushes. ' , coming closer and and as we get in on them we can tell they are thorn bushes and now- , suddenly rising magically in the night, his body flying over the bushes and gone! , early morning, their rifles held in front of them, racing along, suddenly stopping, staring down and . At first we can't make out much. Then we can- a spot of red. , hurrying on again. , and as they force their way through them- , wings spread wide as it floats slowly to earth- -- -as it lands we can see are already there, surrounding something- -but we can't make it out. We are in an area of grass and shadow- -and specks of blood. , cries out in shock and fury, fires his rifle, races forward. screeching and screaming, taking off, and as we watch them soar into the morning sky- 				' (over) 		What the lion must have done, once 		he'd killed Singh, was lick his skin 		off so he could drink his blood- Hawthorne is examining Singh's body, trying to be professional, but he's clearly upset- it's awful. 				 		-then he feasted on him, starting 		with his feet- 				 			(evenb more upset) 		-please- you needn't be so graphic- 				 		You intend ""sorting this out"" tonight? 				 		'll try- but this feels so different- 		that old lion killed could never 		carry off a man Singh's size. 				 			(maybe a little alarmed) 		But you said they were always old. 				 		That's what the books say... 			(Now from that-) . - in tears. Where are we? This is Singh's funeral pyre. Singh's body is being burned. are there. We've caught sight of some of them before- they worked with Singh on the embankment or lived with him in his tent. There is a terrible sense of shock. Patterson stands at the rear. He is terribly moved. Now, unseen by the others, he holds his hands out in Singh's gesture one final time. ; they continue to rise... ' Night. The flaps that were open when Singh was alive are now shut and tied. , the middle of the night. He is alone, fifteen feet up in a tree near Singh's tent. He holds his rifle, ready for anything. He cannot get comfortable. - nothing, no movement. ' . As before. . No sign of movement of any kind. Dead. . Lower in the sky. The night is growing to a lose but there is still darkness. . Battling fatigue- but now, for a moment, losing- his eyes, against his will, start to close, and as they do- . That's all we see, just the eyes and they are near Patterson's tree and they are staring up at him and- , startled, grabbing his rifle more tightly, staring down and- - only they're gone. , blowing on his hands, looking toward the sky. , , . , wrinkled and weary, frustrated and sore, walking back toward his tent area. Now he stops. and a large group of workers- only they're not working. They smoke, play cards, sit around. , steaming, going up to Abdullah. 				 		You were contracted to work- 				 			(gesturing around) 		-malaria epidemic; very sudden. 				 		Let me see the sick. 				 			(not backing off) 		Oh, you're a doctor now, too? 				 		There is no reason for fear. 				 		On that choose to remain dubious. 			(beat) 		Two are dead now in two nights. 			(And on that news-) . Rocked. He didn't know. Behind him now, Starling hurries up, Samuel alongside. 				 			(to Starling) 		Second death? Where?- 				 			(gesturing) 		-far end of camp- man wandering alone 		at night. Hawthorne's examining the 		body now. 			(beat) 		There's even less of him than of Singh. 				 			(just shakes his head) 		But it's crazy- the lion shouldn't be 		that hungry this soon. 			(getting control- he 			looks to Samuel) 		Samuel? 				 		We should construct thorn fences 		around every tent area. Fires burning 		at night. 				 		Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew- 		no one allowed out at night. 			(to Abdullah) 		Send half your men to the bridge, the 		rest with these two. 			(Abdullah nods) 		And 'm sorry for my tone earlier.

They do it with care- these are claws- -, in charge of another area, and he's not hanging back, he's taking less care than the others, hacking away with his machete, moving in between bushes and , into Starling, and Starling taking the blow with his arms- the claws cut his clothing- -his arms are starting to bleed- -he is unmindful, continues to wade into the bushes, chopping at them, cutting them down. He is a good man doing a good thing and right now, he is possessed. , leaving his tent area, lost in thought, going toward the bridge. Up ahead is a grassy area. For a moment, nothing. Then there is the same kind of movement we saw with Singh. Something is making the grass move- -only now there is no wind... . . Did he see it? We'll never know. , in charge of a thorn fence that is halfway finished. His clothes are shredded. has finished with a section and satisfied, moves on- -but Starling is far from finished. He grabs the thorns with his bare hands and squeezes them together. 				 		Not good enough- look, it's got to 		be tighter. Tighter. ' . . ' . We see more fences around more camp areas. The entire place is filled with fences now, all the individual areas protected. The skies are starting to darken- dusk is coming fast. Fires start up. Dozens of them. Still darker. Now workers come racing home to their camps, anxious for safety before darkness takes over. They zig-zag this way, that way, dodging past each other sometimes they slam into each other, fall, get up, run on- . Falling out of the sky. . The fires rise higher. No one moves... . in the main tent area. He is bathing his bloody hands. Samuel is with him. Both are exhausted. Patterson brings them each drinks. They nod thanks, drain them. They stand there together, lit by the flames of their fire. You get the sense these three will be friends forever. 				 		What a good week. 				 		You mean nobody died? 				 			(shakes his head) 		We all worked together. Worthy deeds 		were accomplished. liked the labor.

Even you two must admit that it is a 		glorious thing, what Man can 		accomplish. When there is a common 		splendid goal, there are no limits.

It's high and taut and he's done a terrific job. are working near a large grassy field. One of the men starts a chant. The others pick it up. It's really pretty. wading into the river- he stops as the sound of the chant comes distantly to him on the wind. . It's turning into a stunner of a day- glorious blue sky broken up by pale clouds. . Pauses briefly, listening to the sound of the men. . As before. . As before- -except it isn't. Because if you looked carefully, something flicked in a 180 degree arc. No telling what it was, it was gone too quickly. , . waist deep in the river, listening to the sound of the men, of the birds. The sun is higher in the sky. - -and here it comes again, only the other way this time, flicking back in another 180 degree arc- -still hard to tell for sure what it was but maybe it was this: a tail. Now quickly- wading out of the river as Samuel comes into view. He holds an envelope. 				 		For you. 				 			(taking it) 		Thank you, Samuel. 				 			(watching as Patterson 			opens it) 		Good news? 				 			(glancing at the letter) 		 expect so- it's from my wife. 				 		Do you love her? 				 		 do, actually; very much. 				 			(his wonderful smile) 		You give me hope, John. 			(As he walks away-) , probing at the thorn fence, searching out any last weaknesses. Behind him now, in the tall grass, something moves. Starling, intent on his work, notices nothing. , getting more and more into it. , by the river, reading the letter. There is a large tree up the riverbank. It casts a large shadow. In the shadow now, something moves. Patterson, intent on his reading, notices nothing. 				 (over) 		Darling one- the big excitement 		yesterday was when some school- 		children spotted a whale- 			(pause) 		-they were looking at me, John- , in their bedroom, moving across to the window, staring out.

Now- at Tsavo station- and they sense how good they sound, and they really concentrate on it, on making that sound even better- -there must be twenty of them, working and singing- -and screaming! , turning his head sharply and , doing the same and and they're running now, running and shrieking and that's all we see, the workmen- -some of them run left- -some run right- -and now a few of them are starting to cry. running and running, glancing back, screaming louder, running on and on and -a shadow in the grass- no telling what- but it's big and it's moving and and this next goes so fast it could be a dream- or, more accurately, a nightmare- as it leaps onto the Fat Coolie, brings him to earth, bites his neck in two, kills him, just-like- that. , as they race away from the river and , running from the fenced area- he holds a rifle in his hands. - they freeze as the screams reach them and , on the way to his tent area and listening in fear and , racing to his tent, grabbing his rifle and cartridges and , running toward the screaming and , as he charges ahead, loading his rifle on the fly and , carrying more ammunition, running behind Patterson, keeping up and and nothing is visible now- the men are gone and from this angle, it looks deserted and , catching Starling, leading him into the area, Samuel just behind them. , ahead of them. They move to it, slow- -then they stop- -a sound is heard- from around the corner- the sound continues- Patterson glances at Starling- the sound could be this: the crunching of bones. , checking his rifle. , doing the same. Samuel, holding the extra ammunition, moves close to Patterson. Now- as he suddenly steps away from the shed, rounding the corner and as he does- , with the Fat Coolie- the lion is crunching at his feet- -then the lion stares toward the shed as we , moving out into clearer view, Starling and Samuel right with him. is a good distance away. , a low growl coming from him as he takes the coolie's body by the shoulder, begins backing away with it. , dropping to his knees for the shot and , doing the same and , growling louder and , taking aim and , crying out and pointing and suddenly we're into super slow motion- -Samuel has pointed back toward the roof of the shed and- -and this thing is suddenly there- -this huge dark thing and it seems to suddenly appear from the flat roof of the shed and , blocked out as this dark thing moves across it, fully stretched, it seems to go on forever and , turning around to see and , turning too, and we're coming back into regular motion now as we This enormous - diving into the three, sending them all sprawling and roaring and roaring, running to the other and . , for that is how they will be referred to- -and The Ghost has blood and bits of flesh on its mouth- -The Darkness has eyes that are crazed- -they are destruction bringers, these two, they can kill the old and the young and the fat and the strong- , lying in pain, dazed, shoulder bleeding, trying to reach for his rifle and , the white and the black, as they move toward the field of tall grass, roaring and , lying in pain, his leg is bleeding and ' and , as he reaches it, manages to lift it and the roaring sounds are deafening now and , backing into the tall grass- -they roar one final time- , gun ready to fire but it's futile and he knows it as we and they're gone, the grass is full of moving patterns from the wind- that's all we see- just the grass blowing this way, that way- , staggering to his feet, staring at the grassy field. 				 			(dazed) 		Jesus, two of them... . Dazed too. He points. Patterson registers, turns and , , his throat ripped open. briefly on the young man, then- train from Mombassa is slowly pulling in. And things are fairly chaotic- there is the usual activity of what is ordinarily one of the busier parts in camp- -but now, something new has been added: Abdullah is there with several dozen coolies who work under his command. THey are waiting for the train. Patterson and Samuel are there too- and at the moment, Abdullah and Patterson are in the middle of a screamer- first one of them walking away, then coming back, then the other doing the same. 				 			(shouting over the noise 			of the approaching train) 		-oh, sing a different song, Abdullah- 			(gesturing toward the men 			who stand by the train 			tracks) 		-there's nothing wrong with your men 		so stop telling me there is- 				 			(advancing on Patterson now) 		-you do not call me a liar- you know 		nothing of their health- consider 		yourself fortunate persuaded so 		many to stay- consider yourself 		fortunate have decided to stay- 				 			(losing it) 		You think you matter? 			(gesturing toward the 			train which is close to 			stopping now) 		-Beaumont is on that train- he 		matters- , moving in on Abdullah now- 				 		He sees this chaos, he'll replace 		you all. 				 		He'll replace you, too- that's all 		you really care about. 				 		You think so? Fine. 			(finished arguing) 		It's best you get out. Go. Tell all 		your people to go, run home where 		they'll be safe under the covers and 		when the bridge is built and the 		railroad is done, they can tell their 		women that out of all the thousands 		who worked here, they were the only 		ones to flee- 			(And he wheels around, 			starts to walk away as we-) . Quiet, staring after Patterson. . Patterson has won. As the two of them exchange a quick glance- standing in the door of a passenger car, handsome as ever. Somehow his clothes are still pressed. Patterson moves up. In a splendid mood. Samuel is happy too. 				 		Pleasant journey? 				 			(stepping off the train) 		How could it be? hate Africa. Now there is the sudden sound of men singing- Patterson looks around and we and his workmen, moving away from the train- they are singing the same song that the workmen sang just before The Ghost and The Darkness attacked- it's pretty- but it's also a little unnerving. . Listening a moment. 				 		Lovely sound- they seem happy. 				 		Don't they, though? 				 		So work must be going well? . He and Samuel share another glance. 				 			(delicately) 		Truthfully? 			(beat) 		There has been the occasional odd 		hiccup- but then, as you so wisely 		told me, 'd never built in Africa. 				 		But overall, you're pleased? 				 			(moving in) 		 have never experienced anything 		like it. ; almost longingly looks back at the train. 				 		 almost feel like getting right 		back on. 			(glances at his watch) . They do not breathe. . He really wants to leave and for a moment it looks like he just might. 				 			(a sigh) 		 suppose it would be a dereliction 		of duty not to at least look around. Now Abdullah wanders happily by. 				 			(waving) 		Morning, friend, glorious day. 				 		As are they all. . He takes a step inside the passenger car. . Hoping. . Reluctantly returning. He has a large box. 				 		 do need to see Starling. 				 			(dully) 		Starling? 				 		Awhile back he ordered some bibles- 			(indicating the box) 		-'ve brought them. 			(looking around) 		Is he here? 				 			(beat) 		Yes he is. 				 		Well, need to speak to him. 				 			(helpfully) 		Let me deliver the bibles. . His eyes flick from one man to the other. It's over. 				 		Excellent show. 			(voice low) 		Where is Starling? . The jig is up. He gestures- 				 		Here he comes now. 			(And on that-) ' . They start to put it on the train and as they do- . Stunned. And furious! He storms off the train and we- as Beaumont sees it. Patterson and Samuel are with him. Little more work has been done than the last time we saw it. few men are working slowly. And now there are guards with rifles patrolling it. . deadly look at them. He storms off. as Beaumont sees it- Patterson, Samuel, and Hawthorne stand quietly. It's much more crowded than the last time. Still under control, but barely. Beaumont is icy now. He gestures sharply toward Hawthrone to join them. speak low and fast- 				 		What in hell is going on? 				 		The Ghost and The Darkness have come. 				 			(snapping) 		In English. 				 		It's what the natives are calling 		the lions- 			(beat) 		-two lions have been causing trouble- 				 		-what's the surprise in that, this is 		Africa? 				 		It hasn't been that simple so far. 				 		What have they done besides kill 		Starling? 			(beat) 		How many have they killed? 			(Patterson nods for 			Hawthorne to answer) . Doing his best. 				 		Well, of course, can't supply a 		totally accurate answer because 		there are those that are actually 		authenticated and there are those 		that we once thought were workers 		killing each other or deserting 		from camp so any number give is 		subject to error- 				 			(cutting through) 		How many? 				 		Thirty, should think. 				 			(stunned) 		Christ! 			(whirling on Patterson) 		What are you doing about it? 			(Now from there-) : We are looking at a small railroad car in a deserted area. This is not near the track but off by itself, in an area surrounded by thorn trees. Several workers are erecting a cloth tent to cover it, trying to disguise the fact that the small railroad car is, indeed, nothing but a small railroad car. It is difficult work and they are perspiring heavily. looking at it. 				 		This is supposed to be salvation? 			(staring at Patterson) 		What kind of idiocy are we dealing 		with here? 				 			(keeping control) 		'm calling it my ""contraption""- 		we're going to surround it with a 		boma- a fence, to you- and we're 		going to leave a small opening 		opposite that door. . There is, in fact, an open front door. Patterson gestures for Beaumont to follow him inside. . It has been divided in half by thick metal bars from floor to ceiling. The bars are close together, only a few inches between them. 				 		In that half will be bait- human 		bait- 'll start things off- 			(points to the open 			doorway) 		-a sliding door will fit above that 		and a trip wire will run across 		the floor. 				 			(The smile is back) 		Genius- the beast will enter, 		tripping the wire, the door will 		slide down, trapping him, you, safe 		behind the bars, will have him at 		your mercy and will shoot him. Patterson nods. Beaumont explodes. 				 		Are you running a high fever, man? 		How could you expect something as 		lunatic as this to succeed? How 		could you even conceive of it? 				 		 didn't conceive of it for the 		lions- built one in India when 		there was trouble with a tiger. 				 			(incredulous) 		And it worked? 				 			(He hates to say this) 		In point of fact, it didn't. 			(hurrying on) 		But 'm convinced the theory is 		sound. . They move outside. The tension between them is considerable. Beaumont looks at Patterson for too long a moment. 				 		What? 				 		 made a mistake hiring you- 		you're simply not up to the job. 			(Silence. Then-) . . 				 		You genuinely enjoy trying to	 		terrify people, don't you? Well, 		fine- 			(lashing back) 		-except there isn't a higher rated 		engineer and we both know that. And 		since time is so important to you, 		how long do you think it would take 		to find someone else qualified and 		bring him here? . Blazing. 				 		Let me explain about time- you've 		been here three months and already 		two months behind. And the Germans 		and the French are gearing up. And 		 don't care about you and don't 		care about the thirty dead- care 		about my knighthood and if this 		railroad finishes on schedule, 'll 		get my knighthood and want it. 			(glancing around as 			Samuel appears, goes to 			the workers) 		Professional hunters may be the answer. 				 		All they'll bring is more chaos and 		we've plenty of that already- and if 		they come in, word will get out- and 		what happens to your knighthood then? 				 		'm going to try and locate Redbeard- 		 assume you've heard of him. 				 		Every man who's ever fired a rifle has 		heard of him- by the time you find him, 		the lions will be dead. 				 			(long pause) 		Very well, the job's still yours, 'll 		go. But if have to return, you're 		finished. And will then do everything 		 can to destroy your reputation. Am 		not fair? 			(The great smile flashes) 		Told you you'd hate me. 			(And he turns, walks off) . Moving up to Patterson. Samuel has a bag. 				 			(staring after Beaumont) 		 do hate him. 			(takes the bag from 			Samuel, pulls out flares) 		 want you to distribute one bag of 		flares to every tent area- 			(takes out a flare) 		-tell the men to light them if 		there's trouble- 			(beat) 		-make it two bags. 			( briefly, then-) . . . . lamp burns alongside him. Across the bars, the door of the railroad car is open. Flickering shadows. Above the doorway is a thick wooden slab the size of the door. n the ground, barely visible, the trip wire. . Outside, something is moving. , rifle ready, holding his breath. . SIlence. Nothing moves now. . He rubs his eyes with his hands... on the wall. It's later that night. . The man is bleary with fatigue. He sits in a corner of the car, writing a letter. 				' (over) 		""Dearest... 		...peace and tranquility continue to 		abound here- the workers report each 		day with a smile- except for your 		absence, this whole adventunre is 		providing me nothing but pleasure..."" . It's later still. Patterson, finished writing, stares out at the night. , rising brightly toward the sky. , seeing the flare. The man is miserable. . . 				' (over) 		Fire. The branch is destroyed, the flowers blown away. . . hold rifles. They look like brothers, which they are. They also look tough. And they are that, too. . 				 			(impressed) 		Very good indeed. 				 			(he wears glasses) 		We have hunted since childhood. 				 		All right- you'll spend your nights 		inside. 			(He indicates the railroad 			car. The Coolies nod) 		You'll have plenty of ammunition. 		You're totally protected, you have 		really nothing to fear. 				 		That is correct. 			(beat) 		Nothing. Patterson looks at the three men. Obviously, he could not have chosen better. From them- . . lot of men working under Patterson. Progress is slow. . . Some men sit on the part that's been built. Spending the night there for protection. Now, they all turn and we going off in another part of camp. , in a tree alone, in despair. . Tough as ever. Ready for anything. But nothing is happening. Silence. - . are moving into the river. They wade til the water is up to their necks. Then they reach out, hold hands, start to sing. moving high into a tree. He listens to the sound. Lovely. . The men stand as before, singing softly. The river here is calm, no current to speak of. The men are safe- -or rather they should be. swimming softly, his great jaws silently encircling the neck of the last man in line, pulling him silently away and as the others start to scream- , watching another flare rise, helplessly listening. . - -one of them kicks wildly at the wind. They should be nervous- -The Ghost walks among them, chooses which one to kill, leaps on it, brings it to earth as the dust rises. . . . . seems overwhelmed. . And for a moment we don't know what it is. There is a faint light and now we see what it is we're looking at: a wire. . And now a paw walks across it- -and the instant that happens- , the brothers, in the contraption, two of them asleep, a flickering lamp the only illumination in the railroad car and slamming loudly down and , standing alone in one half of the railroad car- it's incredible, just incredible but Patterson's idea actually worked and The entire of the car- the thick bars separating the two halves. In one half, the huge lion. In the other, the three armed, tough coolies. For a moment, it could be a frozen tableau- both sides are too startled and surprised to do anything but stare- -and then all hell just explodes as we , and this incredible roar comes from his throat, the kind of roar that can be heard five miles away in the night but this one in the enclosed room sounds even louder and more terrifying and , throwing his huge body at the bars and and both his front claws are slashing through and and they retreat against the rear wall of the car. , rage building, throwing its body at the bars again and , pressed in fear against the far wall, unable to do anything but stare and , ripping at the air and , leaping forward, smashing into the bars and are connected and the sheer power of his leap has made them jiggle just the least bit and , staring up at the ceiling and , , roaring and his body hits the bars and - and the bars shake- -but they're not giving way. , as they begin to realize this and , clawing for them and , raging and roaring on his side of the bars and , raising his gun and , his gun raised too and and he's ready and - -and reload- -and fire again, and reload, and- - and suddenly the lamp is knocked over- -and a fire starts, flames grow and it's starting to look like hell in there- -only it gets worse as we- at the bars- -and suddenly it stands up- it seems to fill the car, towering over everything, it's like a nightmare come to kill you- staring up at this giant thing, and of course they're more terrified now than they've ever been in their lives- but these are tough men and they ignore the flames, ignore the deafening roars of the beast and , standing there, going crazy on his side of the bars, trying to knock them down but they're holding and , reloading and , racing around the enclosed area now and he's trapped and the flames make him seem like something unalive and his eyes have never been so bright, his roars as deafening and , firing again and , leaping at the bars again, and they shake, sure they shake, but they keep on holding and , firing, reloading, firing, reloading and as they do, something's starting to come clear- -amazing as it may seem, impossible as it may be to conceive, they're missing. , whirling on his side, roaring and leaping and and sure they fire, but they're still so goddam scared and - it's held in place by some thick wooden bars- -and now the Coolies start to hit something- the wooden bars because they begin to splinter and , whirling, leaping at the bars and firing and then- as it flops open and just like that- . Out the door and gone. . . Patterson stands where The Darkness was. The three Coolies are where they spent the night, on the other side of the bars. This was the lowest point yet for Patterson. Not only had his notion come so close to working, he could never fully comprehend how the coolies missed. It never seemed possible- but of course, it really happened. 				 		Not once?- you didn't hit it once?- 				 		- would never make excuses- but a 		fire broke out- the light was bad- he 		kept moving- 				 		-well, of course he kept moving- but 		he couldn't have been more than ten 		feet away from the three of you- surely 		you must have wounded the thing- 				 		 assure you we came close many times- Abdullah is in the doorway near Patterson now- with several dozen men. And from Abdullah's face, this is clearly going to be a confrontation. 				 		-the next time we will do better. 			(Patterson makes no 			reaction; moves outside) , simmering, moving straight to Patterson as soon as he's out. 				 		The next time will be as this time- 		The Devil has come to Tsavo- 				 			(not in a mood for this) 		-that's ridiculous talk and you can't 		seriously believe it- 				 			(moving in- tension rising 			as others crowd behind him) 		-now you're telling me my beliefs?- 		don't think so- just beyond- something is moving- an animal?- Impossible to say. 				 		 wasn't and you know it and don't 		push it- just listen- we have a 		problem in Tsavo- 				 			(cutting in) 		-at last you're right- we do- you are 		the problem in Tsavo- 				 		-careful, Abdullah- Patterson and Abdullah and suddenly it's dangerous. 				 		You do not tell me ""careful""- you do 		not tell me anything- you listen 		while talk- 			(Now suddenly a shadow 			seems to cross-) . . His eyes widen. . Pressed hard against Abdullah's temple. 				' (over) 		-change in plan- you listen while 		 talk- because you have a question 		that needs answering. 			(beat) 		Will pull the trigger? . We are looking at one of those legends- ageless and powerful, with a tanned face and a thick grey beard. He has seen everything and is capable of anything. Just now he seems more than capable of killing Abdullah. Very calmly, he cocks the pistol. 				 (over) 		It's Redbeard, Abdullah- he'll kill 		you. 				 			(not looking around) 		No hints, Samuel. 				 			(The name has registered) 		You don't know all that has happened 		here- the Devil has come to Tsavo. 				 		You're right. The Devil has come. Look 		at me. am the Devil. , staring at Redbeard. Right now Redbeard just could be. 				 			(louder) 		 am a man of peace. 				 		Am to take it you want to live? 				 		Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes. 				 		Excellent decision. 			(Now he suddenly reaches 			out, shakes Abdullah's hand) 		Your name is Abdullah? 'm sure we'll 		meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid 		morning. 				 			(dazed- leaving) 		 think it's been a pleasure. , and now he does another surprising thing: embraces Samuel. 				 			(three words) 		You got old. 			(Now he releases Samuel, 			turns to Patterson) 		'm sure you're John Patterson. 			(before Patterson can reply) 		Stay out of my way. 			(And without another word, 			he's gone) as Redbeard moves through, taking it all in. It's even worse than when we last saw it- bodies crammed everywhere and always the sound of pain and sickness. Patterson stands in the doorway, watching, waiting. 				 			(as Redbeard approaches) 		 didn't have a chance to thank you. 				 			(preoccupied) 		What did do? 				 		Got me out of trouble. 				 			(matter of fact) 		Nonsense- Samuel would have done 		something. 			(starts to move on) 				 		We need to talk. 				 		Let me save time- (1) you are the 		engineer; (2) you are in charge; 		(3) you're sorry 'm here. Right 		so far? 			(Patterson nods) 		Good- because (1) am not an 		engineer, (2) don't want to be 		in charge, and (3) 'm sorrier than 		you are that 'm here- hate Tsavo. 		So will help you by killing the 		lions and leaving, and you will help 		me by doing what tell you so 		can leave. See any problems? 				 		Actually, no. 				 		All right- let's go into battle. 			(suddenly taking 			Patterson's hand) 		'm Redbeard. 			(as they shake) 				 		Somehow guessed. 			(As they move outside-) . Hwathorne, Samuel, Abdullah, and perhaps a dozen other worker leaders. Redbeard and Patterson move to them. 				 		Starting now, we attack them. 				 		How; we don't know where they are? 				 		We'll have to make them come to us, 		won't we? And since there are two of 		them, we're going to set two plans 		in motion. 			(to Hawthorne) 		First: we must move the entire 		hospital by tomorrow night. 				 			(appalled) 		That's a terrible idea- 				 			(backtracking) 		-is it, 'm sorry, but then, of 		course, you're the doctor, you 		should know. 				 		Silliest thing ever heard of- why 		in the world should we go through 		all that? 				 			(charming now) 		 suppose could answer you. 		suppose could explain that the 		place is so inviting, what with the 		smell of blood and flesh, that they 		have to strike. It's even possible 		that tell you found some fresh 		paw marks around back which means 		they're already contemplating 		feasting here. 			(Turning on Hawthorne 			now- his voice building) 		But don't want to answer you 		because when you question me you are 		really saying that don't have the 		least idea what am doing, that am 		nothing but an incompetent, that am 		a fool. 			(big) 		Anyone who finds me a fool, please 		say so now. 				 			(The words burst out) 		 have been desperate for Patterson 		to let me move the hospital since the 		day he arrived. 				 			(nice smile) 		Then we agree. 			(And on that-) . It was a huge effort and they got half of it done that day- but there was always the sense of impending bloodshed. What we see first are Patterson and a bunch of shots of a lot of workers- laying out the dimensions of the new boma that would surround the place. This was to be by far the biggest wall fence they had in Tsavo. And now here comes Abdullah leading a crowd of men, wading into a huge patch of thorn trees, cutting the thick branches down, starting to load them for carrying- -and it's high noon now, and Patterson drenched with sweat, leads the start of the actual building- taking the thorn branches, bunching them together, forcing them so there is no room between them- -and we can just begin to get the sense of what the fence will be- except at the moment it's barely a foot high- -and now Redbeard appears, beckons to Patterson, and . . Patterson, Redbeard, and Samuel walk quickly. turning to Redbeard and Patterson. 				 		Soon. 			(Redbeard nods) 				 			(to Redbeard) 		 have to ask- why do you need me? 				 		 don't really. But understand 		something- even though it may take 		me two or three days to sort this 		out- 			(Patterson has to smile 			at the phrase) 		-when 'm gone, you'll still have 		to build the bridge. And don't 		want the men to have lost respect 		for you. 				 			(kind of surprised) 		That's very considerate. 				 		'm always considerate- my mother 		taught me that. , who just breaks out laughing. 				 		Why do you laugh?- you don't 		believe she taught me? 				 		 don't believe you had a mother. 			(And as Redbeard 			laughs too-) as they approach. Redbeard walks ahead. 				 		You like him, don't you? 				 		Oh yes. But it takes time. 				 		You've known him long? 				 			(He has) 		Since his beard was red. . . Redbeard, Patterson and Samuel stand near him. and are there. Some of the children look at Redbeard, mime shooting, fall down dead. Samuel translates as necessary. 				 		How many cattle? 				 		Four should do it. 				 		They will want a lot of money. 				 			(to Redbeard) 		Have you got it? 				 		No, but you do- 			(beat) 		-see, you were needed after all. 			(to Samuel) 		And fifty warriors at the camp 		before dawn. 				 			(Samuel explains. The 			Masai Chief replies. 			Translating) 		Why so many? 				 		Because have two plans to kill 		the lions- one involving the cattle, 		the other the men. watching as Samuel tells the Chief. . He moves toward Redbeard and Patterson. As he speaks, Samuel translates quietly. There is a sadness in the Chief's tone. 				 			(translating) 		The Ghost and the Darkness have 		come... and we can do nothing... 		but if you anger them... they will 		stay in Tsavo... and life will 		become more unberable, that know... , watching as Redbeard replies. 				 			(beat) 		Two lions are all that have come... 		they're only lions, that know. 			(beat) 		And will kill them both tomorrow. 			( , then-) . ' . We're not sure for a moment where we are but we can hear metallic sounds. Now we hear voices. 				 (over) 		'll need you by me in the morning. 				 (over) 		Whatever you wish. - ' ' . Patterson, Redbeard, Hawthorne, and Samuel sit around a fire. THey are cleaning their guns, getting ready. . Patterson's is a good rifle and he cleans it expertly. Redbeard's surprisingly, is the oldest. And the way his hands move as he assembles it, he might be bathing a child. Hawthorne is the least skilled of the three. But his rifle is clearly the finest. Bigger than the others, with great killing power. There is a tremendous tension- Patterson, Hawthorne, and Samuel show it. Redbeard is as before. 				 			(terribly tense) 		You're certain about tomorrow? 			(Redbeard is) 		But you don't seem excited. 			(Redbeard isn't) 				 		You don't enjoy killing, do you? 			(Redbeard doesn't) 				 		Then why do it? . . He stares at the fire. Then- 				 		 have a gift. . Silence for a moment except for the sound of the weapons being reassembled. Redbeard's hands fly. His rifle is back together. He stands, nods, goes. , watching him. 				 		Strange man. 			(to Samuel) 		Has he always been this way? 				 		Much gentler now. 				 			(shakes his head on that) 		John?- 			(He holds out his 			beautiful rifle) 		Change guns with me- mine's much 		more powerful. 'll be finishing 		the hospital tomorrow so won't 		be with you- but if you'll use 		this... 			(beat) 		...then will. Patterson, touched, changes weapons. 				 		Thank you. 			(He turns to Samuel) 		Why does he need you by him? 				 		He doesn't. He needs nobody. But 		we have hunted many times... 			(beat) 		...he knows am afraid of lions... - . . Misty- hard to see much. Then appear- -they're not ghosts, they're emerging from the mists. They are powerful and painted and they carry noisemaking equipment- tin cans and tom toms and as more and more of them materialize- .

The best way to ensure the kill 		when you're using trackers is for 		one to shoot while the other uses 		the trackers to force the lion 		toward the shooter. Have you ever 		led trackers? 				 			(He hasn't) 		 can try. 				 			(no good) 		Samuel says you killed a lion. 				 		It was probably luck- 'd rather 		you did the shooting. 				 		You'd never force the lion to me- 		and nobody ever got a lion with 		one shot by luck. 			(points- hand out 			straight) 		Around there's a clearing- you'll 		know it from the anthills- get 		there and hide and listen to the 		sounds- 'll make the lion come 		directly to you.

No lion. - starting to suddenly get louder and point- -because something is there- , and we didn't see it before, only Redbeard saw it before- -but now something begins to move and and it's all going crazy now, and they're starting to move faster and . The noise has kicked up and all the time it's coming closer and and the movement up ahead is more distinct and the Warriors are almost in a frenzy as we - eyes bright- it starts to move away from the sound- -and toward where Patterson is waiting. . Faster, screaming louder and and the fear starting to leave and he screams louder too and - he fingers the weapon. , angrily retreating faster from the sound- and now instead of going straight back it begins to veer left and , immediately spotting the shift, gesturingto the Warriors to get left and , shifting over as Redbeard directed, blocking The Ghost's intended path and , shifting, trying to go the other way this time and ; he spots that too, gestures for the Warriors to shift the other way and , racing to thier new positions, blocking the animal's path again and , rattled, upset, and now it starts retreating back in the original direction- toward Patterson and , and it's as if mass hysteria has gripped them, because their sound keeps building and sure, their throats must ache and yes, their arms must tire, but you couldn't tell that from what they're doing- . Waiting by the anthill. Waiting. Then, at last- , backing into view, staring back at the sound, unaware of Patterson's existence behind him. . Noiselessly he steps away from the anthill into the sunlight. He raises Hawthorne's gun. , backing toward Patterson. , sighting along the glistening barrel. , starting to turn. , ready to fire. , . And now its lips go back as it sees Patterson. , , and this is it, this is the moment and as he squeezes the trigger- , and a totally unexpected sound- a dull snap- Hawthorne's rifle has misfired. , unharmed and desperately workingthe rifle, trying to make it function and . It stares at Patterson. , and the goddamn gun won't work and he's a dead man and - -and for a moment, they might be frozen in some horrible tableau- - - as he hears it, breaking into a wild run- 				 		Shoot for chrissakes!- standing his ground as now takes a step toward him. , firing, reloading on the move, and up ahead is the clearing and as he reaches it- . Its great head turns in the direction of Redbeard and 's position- anthills block him from getting a clear shot at the animal- he curses, races for a better position and . One final stare at Patterson- -then it makes an effortless leap intothe thicket- -and it's safe and free and gone. . . Rocked. The low point of his life. , catching up to Redbeard. 				 		Did you ever see a lion that size? 				 		Not even close. 			(Now he moves to 			Patterson) 		What happened? 				 			(a whisper) 		...misfire... it jammed... 				 		Has it ever done that before? 				 		...don't know... 				 		It's Hawthorne's. . Trying for control. 				 		You exchanged weapons? 			(Patterson nods) 		You went into battle with an 		untried gun? 			(Patterson nods) . . For a moment it's impossible to tell what he's going to do. It seems that a Homeric burst of fury is about to happen. . Drained, he epects it. It's very quiet. , studying the younger man. And when he finally speaks, his voice is surprisingly quiet. 				 		They have an expression in 		prizefighting: ""everyone has a plan 		until they're hit."" 			(beat) 		You've just been hit... 			(beat) 		...the getting up is up to you... 			(And he turns, moves 			off and) . Nearly finished. The fence is eight feet high and Hawthorne is supervising men and material that are being transferred. , checking security in the New Hospital which is close to the center of camp. (The Old Hospital was situated on the outskirts, because they wanted to keep the workers away from the sick and the wounded.) Late afternoon, now. Patterson, Samuel and Hawthorne are moving with him. As are , both armed with powerful rifles. Patterson is silent here, the effects of the misfire still evident on his face. 				 			(to the Orderlies) 		Gentlemen, there's no sickness smell 		at all here, and little blood. When 		we leave, close the gate securely, 		don't open it til morning and keep 		your fires high. Any questions, ask 		them now. 			(They understand- now 			to Samuel and Hawthorne) 		You two will sleep beautifully in 		your tents. 			(beat) 		And stay there. 				 		And where will you sleep beautifully? 				 			(smile) 		Patterson and will be in the old 		hospital- where the enticing smell 		of sickness still lingers- 			(beat) 		-and by the time we're done, 		promise you, the odor of blood will 		be irresistible. 			(And on that-) . . Redbeard and Patterson have buckets which they empty around the inside perimeter- -buckets of blood. . Darker. They empty still more full buckets of blood. Redbeard seems pleased. , hurrying toward their camp. , leading Masai cattle into the grounds of the Old Hospital. , firmly closing and locking the gate. , just outside the fence of the Old Hospital- they carry many large chunks of raw meat, drop them as they move. . Dying... dying... . They slip inside the deserted Old Hospital, pull the gate securely shut. . They stand in the center of the Old Hospital, calling to each other. . Full. Clean. The men are exhausted. Most are already asleep. The Orderlies sit by a fire, alert for anything. . Patterson and Redbeard stand across from their fire, waiting. The cows are quiet. by his fire near his tent with Samuel. Nervously, they drink tea. . Higher. An hour has passed. Perhaps more. . Walking the fence perimeter. . The cows are edgy. He calms the cows. . The large chunks of meat are visible in the moonlight. . The orderlies are calm. , still walking the perimeter. sitting by the fire, staring at the night. Redbeard moves to him, speaks in a whisper. 				 		Think about something else. 				 		Have you ever failed? 				 			(sad smile) 		Only in life... 			(He walks away. 			Patterson watches.) . The Orderlies tend the sick. Quietly. . Lovely. . Stalking the perimeter. No sound. The night is deadly quiet. . He stalks the perimeter now too, on the far side from Redbeard- and suddenly a different and frightening sound- the ripping of flesh- Now we can see both Patterson inside and also outside where, in shadow, The Ghost and The Darkness are devouring a hunk of meat. Redbeard moves quickly across the perimeter, gestures for Patterson to switch positions with him. As he reaches where Patterson was, the eating sound stops. Silence again. Patterson reaches the far side of the fence. Now the eating sound comes again, and again, are outside, directly across from Patterson. looks across the perimeter at Patterson. Whatever's going on, it's sure as hell odd. - they are very upset suddenly- one of them kicks out violently against the night- the same gesture the cattle did just before The Ghost walked through their pen and killed one- -now a different sound is heard: scratching- tracking the sound- -the main gate is starting to be pushed in. Inside the gate the ground is covered with blood stains from where they emptied their buckets. . More pressure against it- it could give way any moment. and from the look on Redbeard's face, this is it! Patterson seees this, readies his rifle and we- , going nuts and then- . All pressure gone. . Patterson is furious. 				 		Goddammit! 				 		It's all right. Stay ready. 			(indicates the blood) 		They know it's there. Patterson takes a few steps away, stares at the moon. ; he studies Patterson who so clearly craves redemption. 				 			(going to him) 		Meant to ask you- the railroad car 		trap. Your idea? 			(Patterson nods) 		Excellent notion- used the same 		device myself once. 				 		But of course yours worked. 				 		In point of fact it didn't- but 'm 		convinced the idea is sound. He goes back to walking the perimeter. Patterson watches him- and for the first time since the misfire, Patterson's mood begins to lift. and an , blood pouring from his throat as he lies by the fire and rounding a corner, seeing the violence; before he can scream- suddenly beside him, and their giant paws slap out so fast we can't follow and , dropping to the ground, and now we're starting to spin into madness and these next cuts go like lightning. with malaria and flashing and , lips pulling back and , falling from his bed, blood pouring from his slashed face and , trying to rise and , leaping on them and , eyes narrow and brilliant and , and he's terrified and he tries to scream- -the sound barely escapes him, but even so, it's the first cry we've heard and , , - ' - -but the New Hospital is on the other end, a good distance away. , rifles ready- but no sound reaches them. , out of his tent, because he's close by and he heard it and he lights a torch, starts for the gate of the camp as Samuel does his best to stop him- -but Hawthorne rips free and we , as it starts to collapse and , as The Ghost and The Darkness enter and , flying across the tent and , shattering and more medicine is destroyed and , of lions' claws and lions' teeth and those terrible bright blazing eyes and , being pulled out of the ground and and what they are doing is this: destroying the New Hospital and collapsing and . . Eyes crazed. , scared shitless as he runs. , moving, as Hawthorne's torch lights the surroundings and , heart pounding, looking around and then he gasps as we - are staring at him. , panicked, stumbling, falling, getting up, staring around- - the eys are gone- -and now there are loud shrieks in the night coming from the New Hospital and the instant they are heard , grabbing torches, throwing the gate open and they're off as we , running toward the New Hospital just up ahead now. , tearing through the night. . (We see all this next through Hawthorne's eyes.) The tents are all down. The place is devastated. . Filled with the dead and the dying. . Ashen. Moving on. Dead. Blood. Pain. More dead. More dying. It's a slaughterhouse. . He's crushed. His body sags. He takes a breath, his last. are on him, roaring. as the roar reverberates- they glance at each other- -then they slow. Because the New Hospital has come into view. , , staring at the disaster. And this terrible crosses his face. For a moment, you think he's going to fall. His body seems drained of all its power. He stands there. Just stands there. Unable to move. . And he does move. Slowly. Carefully. Into the chaos. He stares around- the dead and the dying are everywhere. Hawthorne, his face clawed almost unrecognizably, lies alone. All that's left now is this: the sound of pain. . Dust rises. It covers everything. Only the sound remains. Now different sounds take over- -an incredible babble of human voices. . Patterson walks through the dust. Samuel, a worried look on his face, is a few steps behind. We are at the and it is jammed. train has pulled into the station- -only you almost can't tell it's a train: all you can see are workers climbing up, and the inside is full so the workers clamber up onto the roofs of the cars- -covering the cars- -everyone is leaving- -Patterson can only watch. Abdullah stands on one of the cars- -the train begins to pull out of the station. More and more workers chase after it, get pulled on. Now the station area is empty, the flat car roofs full. Patterson still watches, eyes vacant. Abdullah sees him, looks away. The train gathers speed. Rounds a corner... ...gone... Patterson turns from the scene, begins to walk. Samuel stays close behind him, the worried look still there. . do the best they can. Patterson watches only a moment, walks on. Samuel still behind him. as Patterson walks through. ghost town now. Only Africans remain. where the coolies missed The Darkness. Patterson looks at it a moment, walks on. where Patterson misfired. Patterson looks at it a moment, walks on. And now, at last- ' . One or two Africans. Samuel darts into his tent, emerges with something, holds it out to Patterson. ' . Patterson makes an almost courtly bow of thanks, puts it on- he never takes it off again. He walks on alone now until at last- . It stops abruptly, halfway done; the foundations are in place, a lot of the scaffolding, but it's useless. Late afternoon. Desolate. Redbeard sits alone, high on one of the foundations. He looks as he did the night before. Patterson walks to the top of the near embankment. He is unshaven, wrinkled, he fingers the lion claw necklace. For a moment, neither says a word. Then- 				 			(out of the blue) 		It would have been a beautiful 		bridge, John. never noticed 		before, occupied with other 		business, 	suppose... 			(He's rambling) 		...never really pay much attention 		to that kind of thing but 've had 		the time today, nothing else on, 		and this... it's graceful and the 		placement couldn't be prettier... 		and... 			(He goes silent now, 			stares off) 				 		You just got hit. 			(Redbeard nods) 		The getting up is up to you- but 		they're only lions- 			(beat) 		-and 'm going after them crack 		of dawn... 			(And on that-) - -we haven't seen anything like it before- it's hundreds of feet tall- gorgeous early morning light. As we watch, we realize there are two dots on the side of the cliff. As we watch a moment more, we realize the dots are moving. . are Patterson and Redbeard, working their way along the rock face. Patterson is much more nimble. It's dangerous, of course, but neither of them seems to have that uppermost in mind. They travel lightly- small knapsacks and their weapons. as they make it over the cliff face. They stand, stare out. : the world. They move on. . They are moving along the edge. It's tricky going- if you fell you wouldn't much like it. They are both concentrating on their movements, paying no attention to each other as Redbeard starts to speak. They don't stop moving. 				 		In my town, when was little, 		there was a brute, a bully who 		terrorized the place. 			(beat) 		But he was not the problem. He 		had a brother who was worse than 		he. But the brother was not the 		problem. 			(beat) 		One or the other of them was 		usually in jail. The problem came 		when they were both free togther. 		The two became different from 		either alone. 			(beat) 		Alone they were only brutes. 		Together they became lethal, 		together they killed. 				 		What happened to them? 				 			(pause) 		 got big. 			(They move on) working their way up a steep ravine. It's hard going. They help each other. , moving along the edge of the ravine now. Slow. Silent. Redbeard stops, points- with one odd thing about it: there is a clearly defined archway, as if a buffalo or rhino used it as a regular passage. at the archway. They look at each other, without a word move through it. . small clearing. And at the end of the clearing: a cave. . Dark. . They each check their guns, move toward it. . Closer. Suddenly it's getting eerie. , moving slowly, Patterson right with him. . They're by it- Redbeard squints inside. : it's dark and dangerous and there is a long low tunnel you have to half-crawl through. Without a word, they start inside. , crouched low, moving through the tunnel. Ahead there is light. They move on. - they can see the cave beyond. . They glance down. Nothing much there- just a copper bracelet, the kind a native might wear. Now they move past it and as the tunnel ends, they stand up. - ' . , moving deeper into the cave. It's scary- dark with shafts of light coming from cracks in the rock. It's dank. It all feels as at any moment, the world could end. . . Thunderstruck- 				 		Dear God- 			(And on those words-) . More copper bracelets. And still more- -and now bones- -the floor of the place is littered with human bones- -eyeless skulls peer up at them from all around. The rest of the cave. We are looking at a carpet of bones. 				 		Their den? 			(Redbeard nods) 		Have you ever seen anything like 		this? 				 		Nobody's seen anything like this. 		Lions don't have caves like this- 			(beat) 		-they're doing it for pleasure. , dark and ominous, leading from the cave- -and now there is a sound from one of the tunnels- -something is coming close and coming fast and as Redbeard fires into the tunnel and the sound explodes- - -shrieks- . What the hell is it? - and here they come, screeching and angry- -bats- -swarms of them- hundreds of them- , diving to the ground, lying there amidst the bangles and the bones and the skulls- . Circling above them. Screeching louder. , lying very still, eyeless skulls all around, staring. . For a moment, it seems as if they might attack. . Waiting, waiting. Then- back into the tunnel and , scrambling to their feet. 				 		One of my chief attributes is that 		'm always calm. And then without warning, from behind them, a roar- spin around, start back toward the entrance of the cave- as they scramble half-crawling through it. as they make it, stand straight, look around- beyond- another roar and sudden movement and , entering the thick bush- but carefully, because they are vulnerable now and an attack could come from anywhere- there is the sound of water- -slashes of light hit their eyes, making it hard to see- and they're totally vulnerable now but it doesn't stop them- the water sound gets stronger- and as they burst clear- - - . . They look around. Nothing is there. But the spot is wide open, exposed. 				 			(The words pour out) 		Where could it have gone? How 		could it get across the water? 			(looks at Redbeard) 		They're only lions, yes? 				 			(shakes his head; he 			doesn't know) 		Don't they have to be?... They look around a moment more. Nothing to see- -they turn, leave, re-enter the thick bush. And now- - who knows where it is but it's there- -watching Patterson. on The Darkness, then- ' . - -outside the fence a dreadful sound- the crunching of bones. Patterson, Redbeard, and Samuel emerge from tents, listen. Patterson is on one side of the area, Redbeard and Samuel on the other. 				 			(pointing) 		Both of them over there. He is pointing to Patterson's area. Patterson goes to Redbeard. 				 		Ever have to use a machan? 			(Redbeard hasn't) 		 did once. In India. We will 		tonight. 			(Now from that-) . . Patterson leads the few remaining men in constructing an odd looking structure: four slender poles lashed together, slanting inward with a plank tied on top, a dozen feet up in the air. Redbeard and Samuel approach. 				 		They're used to people in trees, 		not in a clearing. 			(indicating the plank) 		It may be tight. 				 		Not for me- 'm too bulky and it's 		your idea, you go up there. 			(to Samuel) 		Take the others to the water tower 		for the night. 				 		'll be bait alone? 				 		Yes. And 'll be in some distant 		tree where can provide no 		assistance whatsoever. 			(beat) 		Can you control your fear? 				 		'll have to. 				 		 can't control mine- 'd be lost 		without the shame factor driving me. 				 		Was that supposed to make me feel 		better? 			(Redbeard doesn't 			reply. Now-) . . start to tie it down, across the clearing from the machan. Patterson takes a long look at the machan. He tests the support poles- they're rickety. . The sun quickly beginning its quick fall. . Samuel is with the remaining men who clamber up to the platform on top. . Quiet. Redbeard, holding a wooden ladder that is propped against the plank. Patterson climbs his slow way up. It's dangerous. as Patterson makes it, clambers off the ladder, manages to sit. . Nothing is around the machan. He is totally vulnerable. , taking the ladder down. Patterson tries to get comfortable. He can't. 				 			(glancing around) 		It's certainly the best chance 		they've had to kill you. 				 		You think they'll come then? 			(Redbeard does) 		Why? 				 			(not answering) 		Good luck. 				 		Why? 				 			(beat) 		Because think they're after you. . This registers. Finally, he nods. Redbeard starts to leave. 				 		How many do you think they've 		killed? 				 			(reluctantly) 		The most of any lions... a 		hundred...? 			(beat) 		Probably more. 			(Now Redbeard looks 			up at the younger man) 		Johnny...? They study each other in the gathering darkness. They've been through a lot together, these two. They're not what they were when they first met. An emotional moment clearly is at hand. 				 		Don't fuck up. 			(And he turns, never 			looks back, just goes) . He is alone now. . Growing longer. . On top of the water tower. The remaining men are with him. . It peers around. . His fingers move slowly along his rifle barrel- -there is no noise- but you have the sense that, at any second, the world could explode. , a good distance away. bunch of trees. Nothing unusual. : Redbeard, motionless, rifle in hand, is high in the branches. . About to die. , trying to get comfortable. It's not possible. , tethered, but able to move. , testing the machan- not a good idea- it trembles. He stops, stares out at the setting sun, the light hitting his skin, giving it color. and here's the thing about Africa- the sun doesn't just set, it literally drops out of the sky. Suddenly it's bright and in a blink it isn't. As it drops- . . It's madness that he's up here. And he knows it. And that shows. . No moon. Just thick cloud. . Quiet. . On his precarious perch. He scans constantly ahead of him past the donkey. . Nothing moves- . He swallows, moistening his throat. He stares down at the donkey. . . . . And now, just the beginning of a mist. . . . . sitting there twelve feet up as the silence extends, listening for something, anything- -but all there is is silence. . It lies still and quiet. , looking around- you get the feeling he'd like to scream. . The mist is getting stronger. in his tree, cursing, trying to see through the growing mist. , listening, listening- -and then there is a sound and it's so quiet you can barely hear it but to Patterson it might as well be thunder- -from behind the donkey there has come this: the snapping of a twig. , and it's eyes widen- . Because now something happens that hasn't happened before: suddenly there are no colors, only tones- -because lions can't see colors, only tones, and that's what's happening- we are looking at the donkey from the point of view of the lion- . Watching the donkey. And from now on, when we are using ' , everything is clouded and thick with mist, and sounds are muted. When we are using ' , everything is totally clear- and sounds are thunderous. : just mist and vaguely, bushes. : The donkey. And begins to move closer as The Ghost moves, just the barest few steps closer. . Still no sound- but beyond the donkey there seems to be some movement in the bushes. : The donkey, very, very close- . Squinting desperately at the area beyond the donkey but the mist is so thick, he can't make certain of anything. : . . Now there is something else visible, something behind the donkey: the four legs of the platform. . Now we travel up the platform- the four legs grow closer together. . . . . Involuntarily, a shiver. : , but the angle shifts- -what's happening of course is this: The Ghost is circling around the platform in the safety of the bushes and the mist. , following the whispered sound of the bushes moving. He half turns the other way quickly, making sure that nothing is behind him. : shifting as the angle continues to change. as the realization hits: the beast doesn't care about the donkey anymore, it's stalking him. . In the tree. The mist obscures everything. : . Still circling, still closer. , and it's scary now, this thing circling and circling, always closer, never visible and his throat is dry and you know he's just dying to blast it with his weapon or scream for it to do anything but this constantly circling movement. (In truth, the lion circled him for two hours, always coming closer, never quite seen.) : , always the circling around. , trying to turn on his shaky plank, trying to never to let the animal's position out of his sight. : . Closer... , staring, staring at the goddamn mist, about to come apart now with the tension as it builds and builds and builds and : . Closer. , gripping his weapon tightly as his head keeps on turning. : . Closer. , suddenly yelling out loud as an owl lands on him- that's right, a goddamn owl landed on him, thinking he was a tree, almost knocking him off the plank and : , starting to slip off the platform and , fighting the owl away, but his balance is going and he's trying not to fall and : , beginning to topple off and , helpless, balance going, going- , starting to charge forward and Christ he can move and as he starts his leap- , racing from the tree to the edge of the clearing, firing his rifle, firing again and , as this incredible roar comes from him, and he spins, lands, and sure, he's been hit but he's gone, back into the bushes and the night has him and , running, stopping, staring at the ground- . Blood. , moving quickly forward again- . More blood and... , starting to slow- - huge anthills all over, the tallest we've seen, some of them fifteen feet high, some even higher. . They separate, take different paths through the anthills. . Alert. One step at a time. . The same. One step at at time. . Crouched high up behind one of the biggest anthills, staring down at them both. . He gestures for them to stop. They do. For a moment they might be statues. . Spots of blood. Redbeard kneels to examine them and as he does- , launched in mid-air and , whirling, falling, firing and as the sound detonates- , in mid-air, body twisted and- -and . Freeze on The Ghost silhouetted against the morning sky. . THen- , - -we're by the river and this is a repeat of the earlier moment when the three men brought the old man-eater into camp- -only now eight men appear, carrying The Ghost- eight is the actual number of men that it took, and as they lower the dead animal to the ground- - and now there's a flash of light as we , kneeling by the dead animal. He is smiling beautifully, and there is no questioning the look of triumph on his face. ; loads of bulky equipment. Patterson and Redbeard stand behind him, watching him. We're in a lovely spot by the river. Patterson and Redbeard have definitely been drinking. 				 		 think another for posterity- 		this is an important moment in 		my life. He strikes another pose- the Photographer goes to work. 				 		Understand, had help- 				 		-not a time for modesty, Bob- 				 		-undeniably your triumph. 				 		Oh surely there's enough credit 		for us all- let's not forget, you 		did the actual shooting. Of course, 		 hired you, was the general who 		put the team together. And generals 		are the ones who tend to be 		remembered. 				 		Perhaps you might put your head in 		its mouth, sir- could be a corker. 				 		Clever idea, like it. - it is huge- -Beaumont manages to get it open- puts his head between the enormous set of teeth- he's nervous, tries to hide it when we suddenly giving a loud imitation of a lion roaring and , surprised and frightened- -he jerks his head away- -there is the sound of laughter, Patterson's and Redbeard's- -Beaumont tries for his smile, can't bring it off, looks around, humiliated, and as the laughter builds- . . Patterson and Redbeard flank a fire. It's a sweet moment for them, their first, no fear in the vicinity. It should be noted that they both are drinking from bottles of champagne. It should also be noted that the Patterson we see is a world away from the young man who went to meet Beaumont. He's unshaven, his eyes have seen terrible things, he is weary, he has known failure- he is more at ease with the world. 				 			(drunk) 		 never thought 'd say this, but 		'm glad you came. 				 			(drunk) 		Understood- you realize now you 		could never have done it without 		me. 				 		Actually, could have done it 		much more easily without you, but 		for whatever reason, 'm glad you 		came. 			(They toast each other) Samuel, with his own bottle of champagne has wandered over, joins them. 				 			(drunk) 		Where do you go next? 				 		Some Russian princes want to hunt 		the Himalayas. You? 				 		Help finish the railroad. 				 		 want to meet my son- he must be 		what, two months old? They look at the fire a moment. Then- 				 		Three years 've worked for the 		railroad. Now don't know why. It 		seemed a good idea once. 				 		 feel the same about the bridge. 		This country certainly didn't ask 		for it, doesn't need it. 				 		Too soon to tell. They look at him. 				 		My life was shaped because someone 		invented gunpowder. Our lives have 		crossed because two lions went mad. 		But what if in the future the three 		of us do something grand for 		humanity? Was that worth all the 		lives? Too soon to tell. 				 			(drinks) 		Some mysteries should not have 		solutions. 				 			(finishes his bottle, 			rises, looks at Patterson) 		Hold your son high. 			(And he turns, goes 			to his tent) 				 			(beat- quietly) 		He has children? 				 			(beat- quietly) 		Once... 			( on the two 			in the firelight. Then-) , . . 				 (over) 		'd like to see John Patterson, 		please. 			(As he looks up-) standing there in Tsavo; she looks weary from travel, but still lovely. She holds their son in her arms. The kid is adorable. 				 		Could you tell him that his wife- 			(catches herself, smiles) 		-that his family has come to see him. 			(On that-) - Samuel hurries to him with the news- Patterson takes off running and and Helena; she holds the sleeping child, walks back and forth along the shaded front of the building, no sound at all but her heels. , running like crazy and up ahead now is the station area. - and now, in the distance, she sees him and she leaves the building, walks out into the open, smiling and waving excitedly and , excitedly waving back and , moving out of the grassy area behind Helena and , suddenly screaming ""Get back- back-"" , and she's too far away- his words are lost on the wind- she smiles again, waves again and , screaming now, all he has, "" "" and , and she still can't make out what he's saying but just the same, she stops and , stalking silently, closing on the mother and child. , and the baby wakes, smiles and , starting to run and and now it shows on his face- he's not going to get there, he's never going to get there- , and at last she knows something is terribly wrong and she turns- -but too late, too late as we , flying toward her now and , in agony. , leaping on them, taking them to the ground and as Helena cries out helplessly- , crying out helplessly and , continuing to cry out until he realized the nightmare he just had is over- -he staggers to his tent opening, goes outside. . It's dawn. Patterson, shaken, tries to rid himself of the dream. He looks around. Redbeard's tent is ripped- Patterson runs to it- . It's empty. Patterson stares around- -there is blood on the tent floor and quickly- . . running wildly, rifle in hand and , carrying a weapon, hurrying to keep up and , flying across rough terrain and as he and Samuel splash across a small river, he gestures for them to split and they do, widening the area of search and , veering off and , as Patterson rips through them, unmindful of the damage to his clothes or his skin and - he plunges wildly ahead and - it seems to be casting an unusual shadow- Patterson slows, rifle ready, takes a breath, moves around it- -nothing at all- just his imagination which has been working overtime and is only getting worse- Patterson stands there a moment, unsure where to go, what to do- -and then ' on the wind- calling to him- , tracking the sound- Samuel's voice cries out again, louder- -Patterson starts to run and run, and as he rounds a bend- . So lovely. With one patch in the middle that is blood red. Something is moving in the blood red area. Patterson has his rifle ready- -and then Samuel rises from the blood red patch. . In shock, in despair, call it what you want- he has seen something beyond imagination. , rushing across the field of white grass, rushing to where Samuel stands in the patch of blood red grass- he looks down into the grass- -clearly, Redbeard is there and clearly he is dead. Patterson and Samuel stare mute at one another- -and now, from frighteningly near them, comes the triumphant roar of The Darkness. They don't even react. . We should already have a sense of where we are; we've done this before. . Samuel stands there, trying to hold it together. . Patterson stands there too, trying to hold it together. ' . Flames consume the body. Just Patterson and Samuel. No one else is there. The flames lick at the sky... ... . . . , both armed, climbing the crane tower in use at the bridge, not far from the baboon. 				 		You're positive lions hate baboons? 			(Samuel is) 		Pebbles? 			(Samuel holds up a bag) 		Let's get it over with. as they reach the crane tower platform, fifteen feet from the baboon. They help each other into position. Almost night. , baring its enormous teeth, shrieking out into the darkness. on the platform. Samuel tosses a pebble toward the baboon and the baboon cries out again, not in pain but irritation- . . ' . They're both tired. Samuel throws another pebble. The baboon cries out. , , . . He's tossing pebbles now as Samuel dozes. Paterson looks wild; only nervous energy is keeping him going now. . The moon. Peaceful- then it turns bright yellow and frightening black clouds gather and , blinking, coming hard back to reality because the sky is not yellow nor were there black clouds- he's starting to hallucinate. . Samuel is awake now. Patterson stares at the river which is calm. , raging and black and lethal. , hallucinating again. and The Darkness suddenly is there, creeping across the bridge toward the shrieking baboon and the instant it appears- . Firing- - , and it's hit and it roars and goes down and- -, turning, reaching for Samuel's rifle, grabbing it, turning back, ready to fire again- - gone. , blinking, looking around. 				 		Where is it? 				 			(pointing down) 		Underneath. 			(beat) 		Somewhere. ' . The superstructure for the bridge- it goes several levels beneath the level where the railroad will run. They look at each other- not good news and we find out why when we . Patterson and Samuel climb carefully down from their platform to the railroad level. They reach the railroad level. PAtterson releases the baboon which races away. . At the end of the bridge where they began construction. The bridge, two thirds finished, stretches away before them. They begin to walk the incomplete bridge... carefully... ..as they go the look down through the crevices of their level, making sure they miss nothing. . Terrified. Holding his rifle extremely tightly. . Ready for anything. up ahead of them. There are some holes. slowing. . The nearest one is the largest. . He goes on tiptoe, trying to see what's in the hole. . It seems empty. . One step forward. Another. They hold their breaths. . It seems empty. - The Darkness is there. , firing. , going down through another level of scaffolding. , trying to track it. . Nothing is visible. - Frozen. They listen- -nothing but their breathing. , looking around everywhere. . Nothing. of scaffolding. Nothing. of scaffolding. Nothing. , looking this way, that way. - Patterson falls back and fires and The Darkness is hit and goes down but it gets up and , turning for Samuel's rifle- -only Samuel isn't there- -he's taken off for the trees at the end of the bridge and and he turns, starts running too, running across the narrow half-completed bridge and it's a bitch to do it without slipping or falling and , wounded, sure, but the mother can still run and it takes off after Patterson and , making it to the end of the bridge and jumping for the nearest tree and running for his life across the bridge and , closing the gap and ordinarily Patterson would be a dead man but even though The Darkness hasn't got its ordinary speed, it's still faster than Patterson and , and he's never gone this fast in his life and ' , a different one from Samuel's and it's just up ahead and , closing and , and , springing into the air now and , diving for the lowest branch, grabbing hold with both hands, swinging his body up as we , barely missing as Patterson gets his body onto the branch and now comes this insane roar and with his rifle, as he climbs higher into his tree. in the next tree, climbing higher, until he's fifteen feet up. , on the ground, circling the trunk of Patterson's tree, raging with frustration. , exhausted but it's okay now, he's safe, and as he looks across at the next tree not far away where Samuel is- 				 			(embarrassed) 		Afraid of lions. . 				 		It's all right, Samuel- we all 		get hit- 			(Now he shuts up 			fast and-) , as it does this incredible thing- it starts to climb the tree after Patterson.

(And he gestures for 			the rifle and the 			instant he does-) , and he takes the rifle between his two hands and , steadily moving in and , tossing the rifle with great care and Patterson's less than fifteen feet away and , hands out to catch it and in mid-air and , both hands ready and as it strikes a tree branch, spins away to the ground. , almost on Patterson now and , suddenly leaping out of the tree, and yes it's a long way and sure it's going to damage him but sometimes there aren't a lot of choices in this world and , staring as Patterson falls and , crashing hard to earth, stunned, hurt, ribs broken, leg broken and , and it's so big it's hard for it to get room to turn but it does and crawling for the rifle, and he's in terrible pain but he reaches the weapon, grabs for it and , skittering down the tree and as it reaches the ground , forcing himself to his feet and , a dozen feet away as with a roar it starts its charge. , aims, fires and , hit again and down it goes again but up it comes again and , firing the final shot and , hit again and it has to stop, it just has to- -but it doesn't. It roars and roars and moves slowly toward Patterson. ; all bullets gone, no place to hide. . Still moving forward. . He takes a step backward, falls backwards over a branch, lands hard and , framed between Patterson's legs. Six feet away, now four, now- , helpless on the ground. , and the eyes glow- -a branch is on the ground in front of it- it buries its huge teeth into the branch- -now a long dying sigh... and it goes to the ground. . Can't breathe. , dead, its teeth still buried in the tree branch. . . And suddenly he just empties and tears pour down his face and he begins to cry out loud, his body wracked with sobs. He manages to get to his knees, moves next to the animal- . Just the sound of Patterson's tears... . . - - - ' ! -hundreds of people are watching as the first train goes oer it- -Samuel is there- lighting up the world with his smile- -and Patterson's there, too. He stands with Helena, his young son in his arms. Everybody smiles, everybody waves, the train goes triumphantly by. . He looks wonderful again, vibrant and young. Watching him, you might think he hadn't been through the nightmare as he stands there, holding the boy tightly. But with his other hand, he fingers the lion claw necklace... .

It's a major piece of action, running maybe five minutes and it's all as detailed and accurate as we can make it, with as many ""if only's"" included as possible. (""If only"" the tape had been attached up and down instead of around the door, Wills wouldn't have spotted it and alerted the police; ""if only"" the first police car called had gone to investigate, Baldwin, watching from the Howard Johnson Motor Inn, would have seen their uniforms and radioed Hunt and Liddy in time for them to have gotten to the five burglars and then safely away.) The break-in ends when Leeper arrests the five men. He thought he only had one guy, so when ten hands were raised he was surprised. The hands are all encased in Playtex rubber surgical gloves. on the hands a moment; then-- : . The phone rings. fumbles for the receiver, turns on the bed light. He listens a moment. No, no trouble, Harry, be right down. (he hangs up) Son of a bitch. He lies back. The apartment is one room, a small terrace beyond. Not much of a place. lies still, staring at the ceiling. He blinks, blinks again. ... : . It looks, early of a Saturday morning, pretty deserted. Those reporters that are around are young, bright, and presently involved in nothing more taxing than drinking coffee and thumbing through the papers. surveys the scene from his office doorway as approaches, hangs his coat at his desk, not far from where is standing. Where's that cheery face we've come to know and love? You call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarters--tell me, Harry, why should be smiling? As usual, that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly. (chomps on some Maalox tablets) Except (a) it wasn't local Democratic Headquarters, it was National Democratic Headquarters-- ( is surprised-- he hadn't known) --and (b) these weren't just any idiots, these were special idiots, seeing as when they were arrested at 2:30 this morning, they were all wearing business suits and Playtex gloves and were carrying-- (consults a piece of paper) --a walkie-talkie, forty rolls of film, cameras, lock picks, pen-sized tear gas guns, plus various bugging devices. (puts paper down) Not to mention over two thousand dollars, mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills. Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse? (nods) Two o'clock, work the phones 'til you go. : . hurries along, goes inside as we : . comes down it, looks around, sees a door marked ""Counsel's Offices"" and heads toward it. Now-- : as comes up. Behind them, two lawyers are clearly angry about something, talking and gesticulating to each other. (to the ' ) Could you give me the names of the lawyers for the men arrested in the Watergate. These two were appointed-- (indicates the angry men) --only now it turns out the burglars got their own counsel. (he starts to laugh) (to ) When you gonna stop thinking it's so funny. (To ) We wouldda done a terrific job protecting those guys. (neither lawyer, by the way, is Clarence Darrow) You think we're not as good as some hotshot fancy lawyer?-- : and business is booming. Muggers, pimp, hookers, their families and friends. In the scene that follows, a constant counterpoint is what's going on up at the front as an endless succession of petty criminals caught the previous night, the aforementioned muggers, pimps, and hookers, are shuttled in, given a quick appearance before a who sets bond, and then shuttled out. In the audience, one man stands out-- . He is extremely well-dressed and obviously successful. Beside him sits another smaller man, who is unshaven and squints. moves in, sits alongside . Mr. Caddy? My name's Bob Woodward, 'm from the Post and wanted to ask about how you happened to come on this case-- --'m not here. (nods) . He takes out a small notebook, writes, muttering aloud as he does. Douglas Caddy, the attorney of record, when questioned about his presence in the courtroom, denied he was in the courtroom, ""'m not here,"" Mr. Caddy said. (impatiently) Clearly, am here, but only as an individual, 'm not the attorney of record. (indicating unshaven man) Mr. Rafferty has that position. Whatever you want, you'll have to get from him, have nothing more to say. And as he gets up, walks off-- : . There is a small line. waits at the end of it. (moving in behind him) Mr. Rafferty was very helpful. Four Cuban-Americans and this other man, James McCord. Look, told you inside-- --you have nothing more to say, understand that. turns away; goes right on. What don't understand is how you got here. assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved. Probably you're right, but a little while ago, was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars. So? Well, they never would have been assigned if anyone had known the burglars had arranged for their own counsel. And that could only mean the burglars didn't arrange for their own counsel--they never even made a phone call. (looks at ) So if they didn't ask for you to be here, how did you know to come? Without a word, turns, leaves the line without getting a drink. Silently, watches. Now-- : seated as before beside . 's voice come from behind him, and as turns, is seated one row back. Did you know to come because one of the other men involved in the break- in called you? (turning) There is no reason to assume other people were involved. Your clients were arrested with a walkie-talkie; they didn't need that to talk among themselves. looks at , turns back. (turning back) They are not my clients. You're a lawyer and you're here-- -- met one of the defendants, Mr. Barker, at a social occasion once-- (stops himself) -- have nothing more to say. (leaning forward as turns away again) Miami social occasion? (explaining) Mr. Rafferty told me the Cubans were from Miami. (sighing) Barker's wife called me at three this morning; her husband apparently had told her to call if he hadn't called her by then. It was really nice of you to come, since you'd only met him once. Are you implying you don't believe me? have nothing more to say. You don't mind getting on people's nerves, do you? considers this a moment. Then-- Nope. And on that word-- : as without warning, it quiets. There is suddenly a tremendous air of expectancy, you can feel it. Now we see why as five men in dark business suits are led in; they've been stripped of belts, ties, and shoelaces. McCord is taller than the others. They stand, facing the , backs to the audience. sits watching as the proceedings start, but it's hard to hear. He concentrates as the starts speaking. Will you please state your professions. The five men do not move or reply. Then, after a long pause, Barker says-- Anti-Communists. Anti-Communists? (perplexed) That, sir, is not your average occupation. starts moving forward now, down an aisle, moving past kids and whores and all the rest, trying to hear what the hell's going on. At the front of the spectator's section is a fence-like wooden barricade about three feet high. As he approaches it-- The indicates the bald burglar. Your name, please. James McCord. Will you step forward, sir. ( obeys) at the bench is leaning forward, trying to hear but it's hard. And what is your occupation, Mr. McCord? (softly) Security consultant. Where? (softer) Government. Recently retired. Where in government? (we can't really make this out) ...Central... Intelligence... Agency... (he can't either) Where? (clearing his throat) The ... And on these words, : -- leaning over the fence practically falling over it in a desperate straining effort to catch what's going on. (stunned) Holy shit. Now from the courtroom-- : . We are at the end of the press run, the papers are all assembled and being cabled and sent off by machine to various places. As the papers continue to roll past-- grabs a paper, looks at the front page. The Watergate story, headlined whatever it was headlined, is visible. The byline was by Alfred . Lewis. The union type Post employee glances at the article-- (reading half-aloud) ""Five men, one of whom said he is a former employee..."" (stops reading, gives a shrug) Schmucks. And he turns happily to the sports section-- : . It's new money and looks as if it's been recently ironed. Someone is going through the cash, making a quick count. During this-- (..) Hurry it, huh, Bachinski? You said could look at it-- We're in a room in a police station and two men are present. One, a , is nervous as hell and constantly aware of the door. The other, , is taking hurried notes in a reporter's type notebook as he examines the evidence. -- said look, not memorize-- --almost done, give it a rest, all right... (and he looks at an address book, he stops) : . Beside the name ""Howard . Hunt"" is the notation "".House."" Now, hurriedly opens the other book to the letter """" and there is the same name, ""Howard . Hunt"" and beside it, the letters, "".."" (..) What'd you find? (..) Beats me. These notebooks belonged to Cuban guys? (..) 'right. (..) It's gotta mean either White House or whore house, one or the other. We on the name, and the address notations. Then-- : ' - . The phone rings, waking him. He fumbles for the phone and the light, finally gets them both. Bachinski? (reaches for a notebook) What?--hold it-- (gets it open, starts to write) --, go on, go on... : . is opening them, we're in his office, sits across the desk, holding the notebook we saw him writing in. ...go on, go on... That's everything Bachinski had, think it's worth following up. Don't know; who the hell's Howard Hunt? (crunches tablets) It's probably nothing but check it out. Just go easy, it could be crazy Cubans. sticks his head in the office. Anything? Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff-- --in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking. (shrugs) Could develop. Let me see what you get, but don't jump--The New York Times thinks it's crazy Cubans. He moves on. turns quickly to . , get on this .House guy and do a better job then you did on McCord. did all right on McCord. Then how come the Associated Press were the ones found out that Mr. McCord is security coordinator for the Committee to Re-elect the President, otherwise known as ? (getting it straight) The head of security for the reelection of a Republican President got caught bugging the national offices of the Democrats? What the hell does that mean? (hasn't the foggiest) Mr. John Mitchell, the head of , says it means nothing. (reads) ""...This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent. These is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity, and we will not forget it or condone it."" (getting up) You can't believe that. As a rough rule of thumb, as far as can throw Bronco Nagurski, that's how much trust John Mitchell... Now-- : - . : as the triangle sound echoes. leaves large Managing Editor's office, walks past another office, knocks twice on the glass wall. Inside the Executive Editor's office, sits. As knocks, he turns, nods. He appears, for the moment, deep in thought. on the opposite end of the room hurries out of his office, following a bunch of editors, all of them heading across the huge room. As he passes 's desk pauses. What'd you get on .House? (massaging his neck) Lotsa hints-- (not happy) can't sell hints to Simons-- (stops, looks at piece of yellow paper) --you called everyone you know? ( makes a nod) Call someone you don't know. continues to rub his neck as hurries off, all the editors still moving toward the place where the moon- faced man intermittently rings the triangle. picks up the sheet of yellow paper from his desk. Lined, legal-sized, it is crammed with names and numbers and addresses. They are in no neat order; looking at them it's almost like following a path; chicken tracks in ink. mutters ""to hell with it"" and reaches for a thick book, flips it open. : It's the Washington Phone Directory and we're in the 's. As 's finger stops, we can see he's looking at the White HOuse entry number. There it is, just like your name and mine. Listed. Now starts to dial, visibly nervous, a fact he tries very hard to keep out of his voice tone. (..) White House. (casually) Howard Hunt, please. Throughout the following call, we stay on 's face, hear the other voices. (..) Mr. Hunt does not answer. is delighted he's even there. Thanks, anyway-- And he's about to hang up, when-- (..) 'll bet he's in Mr. Colson's office. Let me connect you. (..) Charles Colson's wire. (a little more excited) Howard Hunt, please. (..) Mr. Hunt isn't here just now. Thanks, anyway. And he's about to hang up again when-- (..) Have you tried Mullen and Company Public Relations? He works at Mullen and Company Public Relations as a writer. The number is 555-1313. 'm sorry couldn't be more helpful. Listen, forget it. He hangs up, sits there. His hands are a little twitchy... . Now-- : hurrying (he always hurries) toward his office. , looking for something in his desk throughout this scene, speaks to him. Who's Charles Colson? (stops dead) would liken your query to being in Russia half a century ago and asking someone, "" understand who Lenin is and Trotsky got too, but who's this yokel Stalin?"" Who's Colson, Harry? The most powerful man in America is President Nixon, probably you've heard his name. , unfazed by anything, continues to open drawers, close them, as rolls on. The second most powerful man is Robert Haldeman. Just below him are a trio: Mr. Erlichman is Haldeman's friend, and they protect the President from everybody which is why they are referred to as either The German Shepherds or the Berlin Wall. Mr. Mitchell we've already discussed. Mr. Colson is the President's special counsel. (rising) Thanks, Harry. (looks at ) Know anything about Colson? Just that on his office wall there's a cartoon with a caption reading, ""When you've got them by the balls, their hearts and minds will follow."" nods, heads back toward the files as we : dialing the phone. He's got the Colson file spread out now, and we see pictures of the man and articles the Post had done on him. But basically what we see is plugging away on the goddamn phone and you'd think his finger would fall off from all the dialing and you know his voice is tiring as this montage goes on, you can hear it grow raspy. But a lot of what a reporter does he does on the phone, and that's what we're compressing here. The dialing never stops, the voices are continuous. Hello, 'm Bob Woodward of the Washing Post and... (beat) Mullen and Company Public Relations? Could you tell me when you expect Mr. Hunt? (surprised) He is? (..) Howard Hunt here. Hi, 'm Bob Woodward of the Post and-- (..) (impatient) --yes, yes, what is it? was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate? (..) (blind panic) Good God! And he bangs the phone down sharply-- --more dialing . Now snatches of conversation-- 'm sorry to bother you, Mr. Bennett, but we're doing some investigating of one of your employees, Howard Hunt. (..) Well, if you've been doing some investigating then obviously it's no secret to you that Howard was with the ... (he hadn't known) No secret at all. More dialing. Then-- (tired, voice deeper) Hello, ... This is .. Woodward, of the Washington Post--get me Personnel-- Dialing again. 's voice is showing genuine fatigue. Hi, 'm Bob Woodward of the Washington Post--and--what's that?--you've never heard of me?-- can't help that--you don't believe 'm with the Post?-- what do you want me to do, Madam, shout ""extra--extra""? There is the of the phone being slammed down in his ear. Hard. Now-- : approaching who is working at his desk. He has put in a lot of hours on this and looks it. Whaddya got, whaddya got? Hunt is Colson's man-- (to , explaining) --that's Charles Colson, Nixon's special counsel-- ( almost says something, decides against it) --they both went to Brown University-- (consulting his notes) --Hunt worked for the ... till '70, and this is on deep background, the thinks he's involved with the break-in. What else have you got? According to White House personnel, Hunt definitely works there as a consultant for Colson. But when called the White House Press office, they said he hadn't worked there for three months. Then the .. guy said the weirdest thing to me. (reading) "" am convinced that neither Mr. Colson nor anyone else at the White House had any knowledge of, or participation in, this deplorable incident at the Democratic National Committee."" He looks up at them. Isn't that what you'd expect them to say? Absolutely. So? (he's got something and he knows it) never asked them about Watergate. only said what were Hunt's duties at the White House. They volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty. (to ) think we got a White House consultant linked to the bugging. (nods) Just be careful how you write it. : , makes a mistake, corrects it, types on muttering to himself, and-- : munching a handful of Maalox tablets and-- : taking a sheet from his typewriter, hurrying off and-- : taking the sheet from -- Here's the first take-- nods, shows him out and-- : typing faster then before, makes another mistake, starts to correct it, glances around and-- : gesturing to somebody but not and-- : watching as appears in view from behind the wide pillar by 's desk, heads toward 's office. shrugs, goes back to his typing, makes a typo immediately, glances over toward 's office, freezes as we-- : handing some papers to . They look, from this distance, suspiciously like 's story. : hurrying out of 's office, and-- : watching until he disappears out of sight behind the pillar. hesitates, finally goes back to his typing, makes another mistake, fixes it, makes still another, his temper is shortly to make itself known-- : as hands him another sheet of paper. This is all of it, Harry. , takes it, immediately starts to read as we-- : watching as gestures again. There is a pause. Then appears from behind the pillar and-- : handing another sheet of paper. nods, takes it, walks back toward his desk, disappears behind the pillar again. is starting to steam. Now-- : typing magnificently, his hands rising and falling like Rubinstein's. Behind him is the pillar and for a moment there is nothing--then, very slowly, a figure peers out from behind the pillar--it is . He watches. continues to type, then after a moment, rests, thinks, shifts around in his chair and as his glance starts toward the pillar-- : . is gone. : typing madly away. . is visible again, eyes very bright... now-- : finishing typing, his hands moving majestically. comes up behind him, stands looking a second. Then-- We have to talk. nods, grabs the papers both that he's been typing and that he's been copying from. And as he rises-- : walking silently out of the newsroom then turning left down a darker corridor, passing bulletin boards and wall lockers and it's all nice and quiet as they amble on, nodding to the few people they pass on their way and after a while they turn right and enter the coffee lounge which is empty; the walls are lined with Norman Rockwell reproductions and various kinds of vending machines are visible, selling coffee or milk or fruit or sandwiches and there are some plastic tables and chairs and the minute they are alone, the silence ends. What the hell were you doing rewriting my story-- -- sure couldn't hurt it, could ?-- --it was fine the way it was-- --it was bullshit the way it was-- -- have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?-- (a sore subject) --what have you been here, nine months?-- been in this business since was sixteen-- --and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau-- --you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale-- --Bradlee went to Harvard-- --they're all the same, all those Ivy League places--they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart-- --'m smart enough to know my story was solid-- --mine's better-- --no way-- (handing them over) --read 'em both and you'll see-- And as glances at the two stories-- : watching. Now-- : . He glances from one story to the other. Then, disconsolately-- ...crap... And he sinks down in a chair. Is mine better? nods. (handing the stories back) What is it about my writing that's so rotten? (as he exits) Mainly it has to do with your choice of words. And as he goes, leaving just sitting there-- : , re-entering the newsroom, returning to his desk. He starts to insert some papers into his typewriter, hesitates, lights a cigarette. He inhales, as, behind him, briefly is visible going to his desk behind the pillar. Finally inserts the paper, starts to type as (..) (from behind the pillar) Carl? (turns) Yeah? (pushing his chair briefly into view) Fuck you, Carl. And as he rolls forward again, out of sight-- : . (It's the June 22 Press Conference.) He talks on about something, it doesn't matter exactly what here, the point is, it should include that strange smile of his that kept appearing when the man should not have been smiling. Hints of pressure maybe, that's all, and once it's established-- : sitting alone, gloomily staring at the set. We're in the Post Cafeteria, it's the next morning, and the place is pretty much empty.

Let me lay a little theory on you-- (cutting him off) --'m not interested in theory. What do we know? For example, Hunt's disappeared.

And McCord was carrying an application for college press credentials for the Democratic convention. (to ) The Times has got to be full of it-- it can't be crazy Cubans. What, though? (points to Nixon) It can't be the Republicans--he'd never allow something as stupid as this, not when he's gonna slaughter McGovern anyway. Right. Nixon didn't get where he got by being dumb-- (stops abruptly) --listen, that was a Watergate question-- : . Serious now. The White House has had no involvement whatever in this particular incident. : staring at the set thinking... : walking toward ' desk. Hey? Hmm. What do you think he meant, this particular incident? Were there others? How would we find out? You know anyone important? (sits, shakes his head) lived here all my life, got a million contacts, but they're all bus boys and bellhops. The reporter at the next desk watches them a moment. Then-- What do you need? Someone inside the White House would be nice. (writes down phone number) Call her.

(to the clerk) You do a lot of things when you're on a story. (to , quietly) Can you believe we're actually doing this?

Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand. If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me? Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in. (inhales) You come up with anything?

(nods) Lot of pressure at the Star. (looking at the bills) Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this. (sighs) How much did the damn bike cost? Five hundred; six maybe.

This took them hours, and that effort should be visible to us. They tire, grow punchy, but they keep on, checking phone book and dialing numbers and God knows what else. The point is, we want to get to in a reasonably short amount of time, but we also want people to know there was effort involved. : , bleary, in the reference room, a girl comes in, a researcher librarian type.

What then? don't believe the goddamn story, Howard, it doesn't make sense. It will, it just hasn't bottomed out yet, give it time. Ben, Jesus, there are over two thousand reporters in this town, are there five on Watergate? Where did we suddenly get all this wisdom? and say nothing. They respect this guy. Look--why would the Republicans do it? --my God, McGovern is self- destructing before our eyes--just like Muskie did, Humphrey, the bunch of 'em. (sits on the table, talks quietly on) Why would the burglars have put the tape around the door instead of up and down unless they wanted to get caught? Why did they take a walkie- talkie and then turn it off, unless they wanted to get caught? Why would they use McCord--the only direct contact to the Republicans? You saying the Democrats bugged themselves? The thinks it's possible--the Democrats need a campaign issue, corruption's always a good one. (rises, starts out) Get off the story, Ben--or put some people on McGovern's finances; fair is fair, even in our business.

As it reaches seven and the doors slide open, he steps out and : . It's numbered 710. approaches but as he does the door begins to open so he whirls, knocks on the door nearest him. Now 710 is wide open and several maids leave, watched by a large black man. We'll be back after lunch. (it's the voice from the phone) We'll be here. waits by his door as 710 slowly closes. The maids look at him a moment. He knocks again, louder. think they went out. (shrugs) don't mind waiting. The maids nod, move out of sight. stands tense and still, watching the closed door numbered 710... Now-- : .. - . People are getting off the shuttle, among them. waits. (as reaches him) See her? ( nods) Get anything? For the paper, no; for us, plenty. (The two of them head for the terminal) waited a long time and finally this big guy-- guess a bodyguard-- he left and knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile. And?--And?-- (looks at ) --she was panicked, Carl--every time mentioned Watergate, you could tell. Were you eyebrow reading? (shakes his head ""no"") It was there. just don't get it; a secretary being scared, that's one thing. But what does the wife of one of the most powerful men in America have to be afraid of...? They look at each other, neither has a clue. . Now-- : moving along a residential area in Washington. It's later that night. : - . and driving along. Left up ahead. nods. Who's first? Alphabetically, on the phone list, Miss Helen Abbott of South George Street. As turns left. Now hang your second right-- (explaining) --this was my turf when was a kid. And on those words-- : . We hear explaining-- (..) brought you over one street too many--go back and hang a left again. Now on those words-- : . : and pulled over to one side. , baffled, stares around; looks at a map with the aid of a flashlight. don't get it... this really was my turf... (concentrating on the map) You're not a kid anymore. (shaking his head) My first day as a copy boy was sixteen and wearing my only grown-up suit--it was cream colored. At 2:30 the head copy boy comes running up to me and says, ""My God, haven't you washed the carbon paper yet? If it's not washed by three, it'll never by dry for tomorrow."" ( is getting interested in the story now) And said, ""Am supposed to do that?"" and he said, ""Absolutely, it's crucial."" So run around and grab all the carbon paper from all the desks and take it to the men's room. 'm standing there washing it and it's splashing all over me and the editor comes in to take a leak, and he says, ""What the fuck do you think you're doing?"" And said, ""It's 2:30. 'm washing the carbon paper."" ( looks at ) Just wanted you to know 've done dumber things than get us lost, that's all. goes back to his map. continues to smoke, staring around at the night. : - . sweet old lady is looking out at him. Hi. 'm Bob Woodward of the Washington Post and hate to bother you at home-- -- already get the Post. don't need another subscription. No, 'm a reporter. wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect. The what to what? You work there, Miss Abbott. 'm not Miss Abbott. : - . This time both and are there. Miss Abbott? Yes? We're from the Washington Post and we wanted to ask you some questions about the Committee. : - 'm sorry-- And from nowhere, suddenly she bursts into tears. : and as her door slams in their faces. They just look at each other, bewildered. And a little bit upset; their upset increases as the rejections go on. : in quick succession--they're all in various doorways, men, women, young, old. The only thing in common is their fear. - (literally trembling) God, it's just so awful-- And as he closes the door : -- can't--'d like to but-- (that's all she'll say) And as her door starts to shut : --go--you've got to go before they see you--please-- And as he almost starts to beg : --no... good... She stands there, shaking her head back and forth, back and forth, pathetic and sad. Now-- : . He is seated alone staring at his coffee cup, surrounded by junk food debris. We are in a Hot Shoppe, it's night, and as comes up with food, they're dressed differently from before. puts more junk food and coffee down. You had the Mighty Mo and the fries without gravy, right? ( shrugs) passes over some food. They both look bleary and in foul moods. Silently, they start to eat, something they continue doing throughout. They're not hungry, they just eat. This is terrific work, if you like rejection. never scared anyone before. It's not us, they were scared before we got there. (looks at ) What do we know? Facts or theory? Anything you've got. We know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked. And that something's got to be more than just Hunt, Liddy, and the five burglars--those indictments are gonna be bullshit when they come down. What else do we know? just wish we knew when someone would talk to us, that's all. The continue to eat, bleary and numb, as we : - -- --kind of an honest, hard-working face. and are standing in her doorway. friend at the Committee told us to contact you-- --who was it? We never reveal our sources, which is why you can talk to us. It's safe, try it, you'll see. She doesn't talk at first, but she doesn't slam the door either. We understand your problem-- --you believe in the President, you wouldn't ever want to do anything disloyal. We appreciate your position--really. And now she starts, at last, to talk, and they expect it to be their first breakthrough, but when it turns out to be the most withering onslaught yet, they are stunned. You people--you think that you can come into someone's life, squeeze what you want, then get out. (to ) You don't appreciate a goddamn thing, mister. (to ) And you don't understand nothing. (voice rising) But the Committee's briefed us on you--so get the hell out of here-- (big) --do you like scaring the life out of decent people?--'cause if you don't, in the name of God--stop it! And she slams the door-- : and , slowly walking back in silence back to the car. At Yale once, they held an auction. There was this woman and her name was Lulu Landis. Her postcards came up for sale. She had 1400 postcards written to her and 'd never heard of her before but knew had to have those cards, had to know why anyone would get so many messages. paid sixty-five dollars for them... got all crazy trying to work it out and first it was just a maze but then found that her husband killed himself in Dayton, and once had that, it all began to open, an evangelist had come to Dayton and his horses hit Lulu Landis at the corner of 13th and Vermillion and she was paralyzed. Permanently, and her favorite thing til then had been traveling and all her friends, whenever they went anyplace, they wrote her. Those cards, they were her eyes... They continue to walk; slowly. : - -- - know who you are and 'm not afraid but that don't mean 'll talk to you either--you're just a couple Democrats out to stop Nixon getting re-elected. : and , staring at the man. Democrats? - That's right. hate both parties. And 'm a Republican. The middle-aged man looks at him. (surprised, turns to ) Republican? Sure. Who'd you vote for? When? '68. Nixon. stares at him in silence as we-- : . Only they aren't slamming doors, they're sitting in various rooms of their houses and apartments. We don't see the reporters or hear their questions but the answers they receive make it self-evident. We start with the middle-aged man seen above. - Mitchell never left the Committee-- he resigned, sure, but he was there as much as before-- : --oh, don't worry, Gordon Liddy will be happy to take the fall for everyone because, well, it's not that Gordon's crazy, he's... (pauses, looking for the right word) ...weird. 'll give you some Committee people who know about him--only don't tell it was me-- : --of course we were briefed on what to say--and never to volunteer anything-- : --oh, we were never alone with the , there was always someone from the Committee right there-- Smiles, talks on as we-- : ' . ...No one in this administration, presently employed, was involved in this very bizarre incident... and in a crummy cafeteria, watching the evening news on the set high on the wall. eats a hamburger, smokes, sips coffee. It is night, as usual now. : --on the tube. ...What really hurts in matters of this sort is not the fact that they occur, because overzealous people in campaigns do things that are wrong. What really hurts is if you try to cover it up. : and as the news commentator come on, begins introducing another story. Did he just say what think he said? You voted for him. He gives a big smile. eats his hamburger in silence... : , -- . gets out of his car, walks up, and knocks on the door of a small tract house in the .. suburbs. woman opens the door. Hi, 'm Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post and-- --oh, you don't want me, you want my sister. (calls out) For you. And we-- : approaching the door. She's younger than the cliché version of a bookkeeper. As she looks at her sister-- ' This here is Carl Bernstein-- --omigod, you're from that place, you've got to go. The sister is smoking and there is a pack on the dinette table. Could bum one of your cigarettes?-- As the sister starts for the pack-- --don't bother, 'll get it. And he crosses ten feet inside the front door. You've really got to go. Just let me get a match. He goes into the living room area, picks up a book of matches. This whole scene moves slowly, the tension building under it-- it's not like news people talking, nothing overlaps here. But want you to know that understand why you're afraid--a lot of good people down there at the Committee are afraid. 'm really sorry for what you're being put through. All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff? We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax. (tense) 'm relaxed--light your cigarette. lights the cigarette. You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper when he worked for Maurice Stans at Finance, and we were sort of wondering, did you go work for Stans immediately after Sloan quit or was there a time lapse? never worked for Sloan or Stans. ' (out of the blue; to ) Would you like some coffee or anything? As the winces. (like a shot) Please, yes, thank you. (he looks at the ) Can sit down for a minute? He is by a couch. One minute but then-- --right, right, 've got to go. (he sits) Why did you lie just then? The kneads her hands together silently. watches. was just curious--you don't do it well, so wondered. Have you been threatened, if you told the truth, is that it? ...No... never in so many words... (gently) It's obvious you want to talk to someone--well, 'm someone. He takes out his notebook. : The . And she does want to talk. But the notebook scares her terribly and she can only stare at it. 'm not even going to put your name down. It's just so can keep things straight. (beat) Start with the money, why don't you? ' (returning with coffee) How do you like it? Everything, please. ' (going again) won't be a minute. (to the , quietly) The General Accounting report said there was a 350 thousand cash slush fund in Stans' safe. Did you know about that from the beginning? (about to fold) There are too many people watching me--they know know a lot-- --it was all in hundreds, wasn't it? lot of it was. just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that. Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars. (her words are coming faster) can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried. Which people? The ones who could disburse the money. Who were they? There were a group of them-- think five, don't know their names. Sloan knew which five, didn't he? (she nods) ' (back with cream and sugar) Here we are. don't want to say anymore. (indicating coffee) It's awfully hot-- (smiles) --and you haven't finished telling me about the money-- (long pause; then--in a burst) --omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. thought it was all legal, guess did, til after the break-in, when remembered Gordon got so much of it. (heart starting to pound) Gordon Liddy, you mean? (nods) It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere. (more and more moved now) ...It's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it. Think Sloan's being set up as a fall guy for John Mitchell? Sometimes it looks that way. There is a pause. Then-- If you guys... if you guys could just get John Mitchell... that would be beautiful... And now, as long last, she begins to cry. on her tears, then-- : clicking away. The words "" . . 14"" are visible. There is music in the background, really blasting away, Rachmaninoff or worse. We are in 's apartment and is dictating notes from the interview. It's very late, and has notes on everything, matchboxes, and it's hard for him to read. They're both really excited, from his coffee jag, by what 's dictating. couldn't believe what she told me. Eight cups of coffee worth. Go on, go on-- --we've got to find out who the five guys are--the five with access to the slush fund--they were aware of the break-in. Then tomorrow's grand jury indictments will just be bullshit. It goes very high--we've got to find out where-- --we will-- --she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper. That happens to people. (he goes over, turns the hi-fi on even louder. Shouts--) , go on. The noise blasts away as and hunch over the typewriter. It's a moment of genuine exhilaration. Paranoid, sure, but for the first time, they're really on to something; it's all starting to split open... : They are driving through McLean, Virginia, a development of identical imitation Tudor houses. How do you want to handle Sloan? You mean, who's going to play the mean .. and who's going to be the nice one? ( nods; shrugs) Whichever. He's another Ivy Leaguer so he'll probably expect you to be understanding--might surprise him if you're not. You want me to be the bastard. (nods) And 'll just shitkick in my usual way. As they drive on-- : standing in the doorway of one of the Tudor houses. She is very pregnant. She knows instinctively who they are, and she dominates them in a genuinely proud female way. What mean is, it's her scene, and they're suddenly embarrassed to be bothering her. To see Mr. Sloan. . He's out. (There is a pause. She studies them--) You're those two from the Post, aren't you. (they nod) 'll tell him. (as she's about to step back inside) This must be a difficult time for the both of you. . This is an honest house. That's why we wanted to see your husband. She studies them still; more silence. . That decision is up to him. (conspiratorially) Maybe you could put in a good word. We've got another appointment tonight in this area--we'll just stop back later, all right? . It's a free country-- (beat) --in theory. They nod, start back down the walk. She watches them. . (calling out) Be careful-- They turn, look back at her. : --. . --you can destroy lives. : and watching her. She seems like a terrific girl. And maybe they've upset her. Or maybe what she has said, coming from her, has more impact than otherwise. Quietly, they turn back, walk in silence toward the red Karmann Ghia... : McLEAN McDONALD'--. Lots of very noisy, happy children. and sit surrounded by their usual array of junk food. Think Sloan's back? ( seems lost in thought) What's wrong? Nothing-- just found out that Jeb Magruder from is a bigger bike freak than am. (sips coffee) never like it when the other guy's human... They continue to sip coffee; outside it continues to rain. Now-- : , answering his door. and stand outside, their jackets over their heads, protecting themselves from the rain which is harder now. Mr. Sloan? (nods) My wife told me to expect you. (softly) As you know, haven't talked to the press. We were hoping that maybe now you could. We know why you left the Committee. We know you're not guilty of anything. But we know you know who is-- It has begun to rain even harder. --look, come in. We'll have to be quiet--my wife's asleep. : from the Nixons, they are standing in front of the White House Christmas tree. It is signed ""To Hugh and Debbie Sloan, with thanks, Richard . Nixon, Patricia Nixon."" and we're in the living room. More coffee is being drunk; endlessly stirs his. 'd like to talk to you, really would, but my lawyers say shouldn't until after the Watergate trial. You handed out the money. Maybe there's a legitimate explanation for the way it was done-- --then again, maybe things are even worse than we've written-- --they're worse. That's why quit. and wait as is clearly going through a struggle with himself. Then-- Try and understand this. 'm a decent Republican. believe in Richard Nixon. worked in the White House four years--so did my wife. What happened on June 17 don't think the President knew anything about. Some of his men 'm not so sure of. Do you think the truth will come out at the trial? That's another of the things 'm not so sure of. Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors? We were never told flat out ""Don't talk."" But the message was clear. To cover up? Well, they sure didn't ask us to come forward and tell the truth. Does ""they"" mean the White House? As opposed to the Committee? The Committee's not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. don't think that the or the prosecutors understand that. The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true? No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand. And as treasurer, you could release those funds? (nods) When so ordered. We're not sure we've got all the guys who could order you, but we know there were five. ( is silent) (ticking them off) Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, they're obvious-- stirs his coffee. --there had to be a White House overseer-- --Colson. Colson's too smart to get directly involved with something like that. (to ) Haldeman. (to ) Right? won't talk about the other two. But they both worked at the White House? (softly) will not talk about the other two. (out of the blue) Kalmbach--Nixon's personal lawyer. is shocked at the mention of Kalmbach. can't say anything, 'm sorry. (He starts to rise) One thing 'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work? Badly. (and now for the first time, he almost smiles) You don't realize how close all this came to staying undiscovered-- gave Liddy the Dahlberg check and he gave it to Barker who took it to Miami and deposited it. Right. Then Barker withdrew the 25 thousand in hundred dollar bills and gave it back to Liddy who gave it back to me and put it in the office safe which was crammed. Go on. Well, when Liddy came and asked for money for what turned out to be the break-in funds, went to the safe and gave him--out of this whole fortune-- happened to give him the same hundreds he gave me--banks have to keep track of hundreds. If the money had been in fifties, or if 'd grabbed a different stack, there probably wouldn't have been any Watergate story. Ordinarily, though, what was the procedure? Routine--'d just call John Mitchell over at the Justice Department and he'd say ""go ahead, give out the money."" and just look at each other--they hadn't known it, not remotely. stands and as they head for the door-- : heading across the foyer. What happens when the baby comes? We're moving. (beat) 've been looking for a job but it's been... hard. My name's been in the papers too much. Sometimes wonder if reporters understand how much pain they can inflict in just one sentence. 'm not thinking of myself. But my wife, my parents, it's been very rough on them. : and looking very uncomfortable as goes on. wish could put down on paper what it's like--you come to Washington because you believe in something, and then you get inside and you see how things actually work and you watch your ideals disintegrate. (beat) The people inside, the people in the White House, they start to believe they can suspend the rules because they're fulfilling a mission. That becomes the only important thing-- the mission. It's so easy to lose perspective. We want to get out before we lose ours altogether. opens the front door. and pause, nod, almost an embarrassed pause. Then as they hurry out into the rain-- : flying toward a basket cupped to a picture window. When we we're in 's office, and are also there, along with and . plays nerfball mostly; he hasn't got the worlds's longest attention span. Look--five men controlled that slush fund as --three of them we've got, Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, and we're pretty sure of Kalmbach. We'd like to wait til we have all five before we print it. This is a daily paper, we'll explain it tomorrow. (looks at them) You're certain on Mitchell? He approved the payments to Liddy while he was still Attorney General-- And all this now goes fast-- --you got more than one source?-- --yes-- --has any of them got an ax?-- --political, personal, sexual, anything at all against Mitchell?-- --no-- --can we use their names?-- --no-- --goddamnit, when's somebody gonna go on the record on this story-- --who you got?-- --well, Sloan-- --and we got a guy in Justice-- --Deep Throat?-- -- saw him. He verifies. . (now after the burst of talk, a pause) You're about to write a story that says that the former Attorney General-- the man who represented law in America-- is a crook. (throws the nerfball) Just be right, huh? As and leave the office-- Leave plenty of room for his denial. : . He has some papers in front of him an a notepad and pencil in his free hand. He is tired and very, very nervous. It is dark outside. In what follows, takes notes. ' (..) Essex House, can help you? John Mitchell, please. There is a . Then-- ' (..) Yes? Sir, this is Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post, and 'm sorry to bother you but we're running a story in tomorrow's paper that we thought you should have a chance to comment on. (..) What does it say? (starting to read) John . Mitchell, while serving as Attorney General, personally controlled a secret cash fund that-- (..) --jeeeeeeesus-- --fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats-- (..) --jeeeeeeesus-- --according to sources involved in the Watergate investigation. Beginning in the spring of 1971-- (..) --jeeeeeeesus-- --almost a year before he left the Justice Department-- (..) --jeeeeeeeeesus-- --to become President Nixon's campaign manager on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund-- (..) --all that crap, you're putting it in the paper? It's all been denied. You tell your publisher--tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. Good Christ! That's the most sickening thing ever heard. Sir, 'd like to ask you a few-- (..) --what time is it? 11:30. (..) Morning or night? Night. (..) Oh. And he hangs up. : and at 's desk. is going over 's notes. He really made that remark about Mrs. Graham? ( nods) This is a family newspaper--cut the words ""her tit"" and run it. And now suddenly-- rolling the story. They're modern and gigantic and : and . They're in the lobby of the Post at night and through a thick-pane of glass they're watching their story roll and on their faces is something you don't expect to see: panic. comes up behind them, looks down at the presses, starts to talk. Once when was reporting, Lyndon Johnson's top guy gave me the word they were looking for a successor to . Edgar Hoover. wrote it and the day it appeared Johnson called a press conference and appointed Hoover head of the for life... And when he was done, he turned to his top guy and the President said, ""Call Ben Bradlee and tell him fuck you."" (shakes his head) took a lot of static for that-- everyone said, ""You did it, Bradlee, you screwed up--you stuck us with Hoover forever--"" (looks at and ) -- screwed up but wasn't wrong. They all watch the presses now. You guys haven't been wrong yet, is that why you're scared shitless? (as and nod, starts away) You should be... : continuing to roll. The is incredible. Now-- : clacking away like crazy. We can read the words, ""The Senator finished by saying that although he was..."" and from there-- : and while the words ""although he was"" are still very fresh in our minds-- Although am a Republican, would like to state in a pure bipartisan spirit that feel only sadness that a once fine journal of record like the Post would have become merely the hysterical spokesman for the equally hysterical left wing of the Democratic Party-- The of the teletype doesn't stop in this little part and we see three people and it's very important that their voices are immediately recognizable and distinct. One, the is from the West and will have that twang. The next two whom we are about to meet are from and the . The voice is very southern, the sounds like an announcer. The will be seen in a corridor of the Senate office building, talking to reporters, the .. will be talking to reporters in front of the office doors and so identified. The will be standing on a platform with a flag visible off to one side. As the teletype goes on-- : .. .. (in mid-sentence) --hearsay, innuendo, and character assassination. can only conclude that the so-called sources of the Washington Post are a fountain of misinformation-- : --the White House has long since stopped being surprised at this type of reporting by certain elements of the Eastern liberal press-- : ' lot of activity. is at his desk reading the teletype dispatches. and are there, and , too. kid comes in with more teletype stuff. The editors look at it. (reading) Same kind of crap-- (glancing through; nods) --all non-denial denials--we're dirty guys and they doubt we were ever virgins but they don't say the story is inaccurate. What's a real denial? If they ever start calling us goddamn liars-- (little pause) --it's time to start circling the wagons. : looking at a new headline: You think they know what they're doing on the fifth floor? got eight kids to support--they better. They start for the sports section, only this time, they stop, go back, stare at the headline again. From them watching-- : walking to the elevators. What do you think Mrs. Graham wants to see me for? Maybe to fire you--since you two started on this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent? ( pushes for the elevator) And the word is some Nixon people are challenging her licenses. 'm not saying she's going on relief, but don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you. You think she wants us to ease up on the story? (shrugs) don't know, but don't think that's unreasonable either, do you? The elevator opens. shakes his head ""no"" and steps inside as we : . in her office as a lets in. He's nervous. She's standing by the window, he crosses to her. . 'm so glad you could come, Mr.-- --'m Woodward. She nods. There's a pause. He waits. She's trying to say something, get something started, but it's difficult. Silence. She stares out again, quietly starts to talk. . You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said ""don't, don't"" and was frightened but knew if said no, 'd lose the whole fifth floor. So we published, and that night, after 'd told Ben to go ahead, woke up in the darkness and thought, ""Oh my Lord, what am doing to this newspaper?"" (She looks at ) woke up again last night with that same question. ( says nothing, waits) Are we right on this story? think so. . Are you sure? No. . When will you be, do you think?-- when are we going to know it all? It may never come out. . Never? Please don't tell me never. (beat) Ben says you've found some wonderful sources. Some Justice Department lawyers and an man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am. . And the underground garage one. (, more nervous now, nods) Would know him? couldn't say. . But it's possible. (throat very dry) It is. . You've never told anyone who he is? ( shakes his head) But you'd have to tell me if asked you. ( nods) Tell me.

The laughter came from her. . wasn't serious. have plenty of burdens to carry around, don't need another. tries not to exhale too audibly. . We're going to need lots of good luck, aren't we? Nobody ever had too much. : --. as abruptly she reaches out, touches on the arm. . Do better. makes a nod. . Then-- : in a state of anger, pacing around the tiny teletype room. hurries in. What? says nothing, just points to the teletype. looks at it, clearly is upset. thought you guys were supposed to be working on this story-- (to who tears in--) --you think like being aced out? --what?-- --The .. Times has a huge interview with Baldwin-- --the lookout in the Motor Inn?-- ( nods) --he say anything we don't know?-- (headshake) --just that a lot of reports were sent to , but he doesn't name who, not here anyway-- --it would have been nice to have had this, sure would have liked to have had this-- --there's nothing new in it-- --it makes the break-in real--it's a major goddamn story-- (starts out) --'m not going to kick ass over this, but 'd like you to know hate getting beat, just hate it-- don't forget that hate it-- And he stalks out. and stand staring at the teletype which keeps on clacking and clacking as the .. Times story keeps getting longer. Goddamnit-- --shit-- --we gotta top the Times-- -- know, know-- --if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again-- --shit, who do we know?-- -- know a lawyer at Justice-- --has he got an ax?-- --almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat. Then he's got an ax. (beat) Call him anyway. As nods, takes off out of the room-- : studying the front page, on which one headline indicates that they're named the guys at who got the reports. Who is this Woodstein? (points to paper) Two stories on the front page. If he can't pick a winner at Pimlico, to hell with him. : . is stirring his morning coffee as comes in, spots him, hurries over. is maybe more excited then we've yet seen him. -- want you to shut up and listen to me-- -- haven't said anything-- --for the first time 'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward, got a tip. guy called me up with a tip-- (carefully) --someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. The knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through. But Segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing. How high up, which Republicans? That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men-- --Haldeman know, who else? Dwight Chapin, Nixon's appointments chief--he knew Segretti in school. Maybe 'm crazy, but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense. What were the three theories? The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans. Now the reason no one believed the Republicans is because there wasn't any reason, they were so far ahead. But Segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break- in. So maybe Watergate wasn't really about Watergate--maybe that was just a piece-- --because a year before, the Republicans weren't ahead, not in the polls, Muskie was running ahead of Nixon then. Before he self- destructed. If he self-destructed. Now, from the two of them-- : . There is the of bad guitar music, which as we we see is playing. We are in his apartment, it's night, and the two of them, bleary, are studying the maze of receipts. Segretti criss-crossed the country over ten times in six months--and never stayed anyplace over a night or two. (glancing up) Switch to another station, huh? You're driving me crazy with that. Segovia begged me for me secret but said, ""No, Andres, you'll have to try and make it without me."" He switches to another song which sounds a lot like the one he just finished playing. (pointing to the thickest stacks) California, Illinois, Florida, New Hampshire--all the major Democratic primary states. (whirling) Why does everything you play sound the same? --'cause only know four chords-- : . The camera moves across the travels of Donald Segretti. There is the of 's guitar. for a moment, then-- : , - standing in his doorway. (..) Donald Segretti? That's right. : -- . We are, it will soon be clear, in California now, Marina Del Rey. 'm Carl Bernstein. ( nods) My paper sent me out to see if couldn't persuade you to go on the record. You can't. Mind if try? shrugs, and as they enter his apartment-- : . They walk across to a small terrace outside, where they sit. The terrace has a glorious view of the water and lots of girls in bathing costume, below. According to what we've been able to verify, you've been busy. 've got a lot of energy. Listen--we know you're involved in this--we're going to get the story, why not help? They never told me anything except my own role-- had to find out the rest in the papers. By ""they"" you mean...? He waits; just shakes his head. By ""they"" you mean the White House, don't you? ( makes no reply) Your buddy from , Dwight Chapin-- he works for the White House. know where Dwight works. When did he hire you? shakes his head, stares out at the girls. Do you feel much about the things you did? didn't do anything wrong. Tell that to Muskie. Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff. During the Florida primary, you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child. You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls. Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe-- (to ) --off the record. You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians. didn't. But you know who did. When you guys print it in the paper, then 'll know. (closes his eyes) 'm a lawyer, and 'll probably go to jail, and be disbarred, and what did do that was so awful? says nothing, waits. None of it was my idea, Carl-- didn't go looking for the job. Chapin did contact you then? Sure--off the record. On the orders of Haldeman? don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him-- everybody's frightened of him--Christ, wish 'd never gotten messed around with this--all wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls. It gets interesting if it was Haldeman, because our word is that when Chapin says something, he's gotten the from Haldeman, and when Haldeman says something, he's gotten the from the President. Can't help you. At , you had a word the this-- screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking. ( half-smiles, nods) Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them all? : -- staring at the girls and the blue water. What would you have done if you were just getting out of the Army, if you'd been away from the real world for four years, if you weren't sure what kind of law you wanted to practice, and then one day you got a call from an old friend asking you to go to work for the President of the United States...? on the question, then-- : back in .., walking through the airport. What would you have done? You asking would have been one of the President's men? (beat) would have been. As they continue on-- : alone in the underground garage. Tense, jumpy. He looks at his watch, paces around. It's all eerie as hell. Then, from the ramps, footsteps. : moving out of the shadows, smoking, as always. My turn to keep you waiting. (approaches) What's the topic for tonight? Ratfucking. In my day, it was simply called the double cross. believe the refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats. know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House. (nods) Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government. Who?--be specific. How high up? You'll have to find that out, won't you. The slush fund at financed the ratfucking, we've almost got that nailed down, so-- He stops as suddenly dives down behind the nearest car. dropping beside him. What? Did you change cabs? (as nods) It didn't work, something moved there-- And as he points : . You can't see a goddamn thing. But there is the , faint but distinct, of breathing. : standing, staring into the darkness. He is scared, wipes his mouth. He doesn't move for a moment. Then he walks directly into the darkness and as he's gone-- : , red eyed, unshaven, beaten--there are half-formed scabs and cuts. He is leaning against a wall, shivering. He looks, for all the world, like a perpetual drunk. : in the shadows, coming closer. : . He blinks slowly, tongue lolling outside his mouth. He watches approach. : coming still closer. : . He blinks very slowly now. Maybe he isn't even certain 's there. : stopping in front of the drunk. They look at each other for a long time. Then: Who are you? : . Nothing, no reaction. : studying the other man. : . And he blinks again, then slowly, shivering, begins sliding down the wall. reaches for him, holds him up. : managing to get out his wallet, take out some bills. He starts up the ramp with the drunk, and as they disappear up the ramp out of sight, he gives the drunk the money. Here. (softly) Forget your troubles and just be happy. : pacing and smoking. He is visibly upset; scared maybe. He glances over as comes back down the ramp alone. (self-mocking) hope you noticed how coolly behaved under the threat of discovery. (impatiently) Do Justice and the know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it? They know, but they focused on the burglary--if it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it. Why didn't they?--who told them not to? Someone with authority 'd imagine, wouldn't you? (coughs) Don't you know what you're onto? Come on. Mitchell knew then. Of course--my God, you think something this big just happens? The break-in and the cover up, of course Mitchell knew, but no more than Ehrlichman. Haldeman too? You get nothing from me about Haldeman? And from this tone, you know scares him. Why did they do all this for Chrissakes?--what were they after? Total manipulation. suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines. Talk about Segretti-- --don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too. There were more then. Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere-- --the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation-- (nods, bigger) --don't you miss the grand scheme too. How grand? Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti. And Justice and know all this? Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief. (stunned) Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats? : was being cautious. (inhales) You can safely say more then fifty... in the garage. ... then-- : and it's noisy. Not as noisy as it's going to get, but there is more tension around just now than there has been previously. : -30s. On her desk is her name, . She is watching who is standing by the water cooler nearby. As she gets up-- : drinking water. Do you guys know about the Canuck letter? (nods, drinks) Um-hmm. (stops, looks at her) Why? just wanted to be sure you knew who wrote it. As she speaks-- : working at his desk, suddenly looking up as a comes from the direction of the water cooler and as everyone turns to see, here comes dragging over to 's desk. (hysterical) Tell him what you just told me. Just than Ken Clawsen--he used to be a reporter here before he went to work for Nixon-- had him over for a drink a few weeks ago and he told me he wrote the Canuck letter. (she looks from one of them to the other) You did want to know, didn't you? And now from her-- : and in a corner of the room, talking low and fast. You think we're being set up?--Christ, Deep Throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the White House and up traipses Marilyn naming names. It makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they have at the White House? Each new member of the President's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of Nixon. You think this was Clawsen's initiation? Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal. (beat) God knows it worked. : in tears, standing on the flat-bed truck. This was in the New Hampshire primary, just after the Canuck letter was published. (..) You claiming it was all a misunderstanding, Ken? (..) Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong-- : She's an awfully good reporter-- can't remember her getting too much wrong before, can you? (..) That's a bullshit question, that's a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas. Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen? (..) Where? (beat) What do you mean, where? Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant-- (..) --'ve completely forgotten where it was, except know it wasn't her apartment. There is a sound of him hanging up the phone. Hard. hangs up quietly, rubs his eyes, calls out to who is at her desk-- Non denial-denial, Marilyn-- is about to answer when her phone rings. She picks it up, turns to , mouths ""it's him"" and we : . Again Clawsen on the other end. (..) For Chissakes, don't tell them came to your place. already told them. (..) Oh, that's terrific, that's just so terrific, 'm thrilled you did that. have a clear conscience. (..) Marilyn, have a wife and a family and a cat and a dog. Now from this-- And we : and heading toward the office. As they enter-- got Clawsen on hold-- --his dialing finger must be falling off-- --what do you think?-- --he went to her apartment and he told her-- --if he did it or just said he did it, God knows. could care less about where it happened; what happened is what counts. (calling out to his ) Put him on. (picks up the phone) Ken, 'm sorry, it was Goddamn Beirut and they were having a crisis, what's up, kid? (pause) Slow down, Ken, you sound frazzled. (pause) wife and a family and a cat and a dog, right, Ken. (pause) Ken, would never print that you were in Marilyn's apartment at night-- unless, of course, you force me to. : --. He is genuinely enjoying himself. Now, he puts his hand over the receiver-- It's like they taught us at Harvard: few things are as gratifying to the soul as having another man's nuts in a vise... Now, as he goes back to talking-- : : . Now we on that headline as the three deniers are visible through it in the same places they spoke before. The story is based entirely on hearsay and-- .. --we at the Committee are continually amazed at the creativity shown by the Washington Post-- --although am a Republican, would like to state in a pure bipartisan spirit that am happy that this latest onslaught against the intelligence of the American people will be wrapping fish tomorrow. offer my condolences to the fish... And now, the headline fades as we : ' and hurry in. Speak. We've just been talking to Young-- --which Young? Larry Young, a California lawyer-- --he was going to go into law practice with Segretti. And?-- --and he says Chapin hired Segretti-- --well and good, but when will he say it on the record. He just did. He'll give us a sworn statement. We're inside the White House now. and just look at each other. They should be happy, and maybe they are. But at the moment more then anything else they look scared... . Then-- . It's a very fancy restaurant and is at a corner table as and sit down. They are exhausted. Look, wanted to talk because things are getting really hairy and there's a couple of things we've got to be careful of because-- waiter is nearby. --either of you want a drink or should order?-- (They don't) --because-- And suddenly he lapses into perfect French with the waiter, ordering lunch ann salad and as the waiter nods and goes --because our cocks are on the chopping block and you've got to be sure that you're not just dealing with people who hate Richard Nixon and want to get him through us. You see, don't give a shit who's President-- really don't, it's an adversary situation between them and us and it's always gonna be. never had a closer friend than Jack Kennedy and once printed something that pissed him off and for seven months didn't exist. wine steward appears, hands the list. As he examines it, a man walks up to the table, stands there... You none of you know who am, do you?

Glenn Sedam--you wrote about me last week, you said was one of the guys at the Committee who was sent reports. You were wrong. Baldwin told the it was you. Baldwin told the it was someone whose first name sounded like a last name. They showed him a list and he picked me but it wasn't me, it was Gordon Liddy. (looks at the reporters) My phone hasn't stopped ringing, my wife's hysterical, my kids think 'm mixed up with the burglary, my friends don't like me around all of a sudden. : -- You fucked around my life, you two. (starts off) just wanted to say thanks. watching and , who are clearly upset. That didn't sound to me like a non- denial denial; could you have been wrong? (they nod) You had a good source? (nod) Did he have an ax? (pause. Then another nod) -- All right, you made a mistake maybe, we all have, just don't make another. And watch your personal lives, who you hang around with. Someone once said the price of democracy is a bloodletting every ten years. (beat) Make sure it isn't our blood... Now from -- : holding a broom and dustpan at his front door. really can't talk now-- --this'll only take one second-- --my wife just had the baby, my in- laws are arriving, 'm trying to get the house in some kind of shape. boy or a girl? girl.

(holding up a cup) Where does this go? points to a shelf. moves to put the cup in its proper place. --That cash fund that financed the sabotaging of the Democrats--five guys had control-- (ticking them off) --Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach-- --we're working on the last guy now and we're going all the way--that fifth man was Haldeman. --'m not your source on that-- --it's gotta be Haldeman--someone from the White House had to be involved-- --and it wasn't Ehrlichman or Colson or the President. No, none of those. --that leaves Haldeman, period. 'm not your source on that. He picks up a dust pan, starts sweeping it full. (taking the dust pan, helping out) --look, when the Watergate grand jury questioned you, did you name names? Of course--everything they asked-- --if we wrote a story that said Haldeman controlled the fund?-- --let me put it this way: 'd have no problem if you did. and look at each other while empties the dust pan into the trash and from there, quickly-- : walking in the park. We can't really make them out clearly, we never do in this little sequence. But the guy is wearing a windbreaker and has a crew cut and the woman with him is dressed casually too. He has his arm around her, and they are deep in conversation. ' (..) Hey? and sitting on a park bench swilling down a six-pack. think that's him. Who? Haldeman. : walking along. We just can't quite make them out. But it might be. : and staring after the couple, trying to focus. Nah. (squints hard) Maybe. What if went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me? Well, we are trying to ruin his life. It's nothing personal, though. (looks troubled) What's the matter? Same as Magruder, don't like it when they turn out to be human. (nods) wish we were investigating Attila the Hun. Maybe we are... : - . They continue on. We still don't see them quite clearly. ... then-- : - . - . and are at the adjoining table. --Goddamnit, 'm not gonna say it again--you get nothing about Haldeman outta me-- --we don't need it now, because tomorrow's story is about the -- --about how all you supposed experts really blew the whole investigation-- (stung) --we didn't miss so much-- --you never knew Haldeman had control of the slush fund-- --it's all in our files-- --not about Haldeman-- --yeah, Haldeman, John Haldeman. And he gets up quickly, goes. and savor the moment but only briefly as it hits them-- --Jesus-- --he said John Haldeman, not Bob Haldeman-- And as they take off after the agent-- : ' . , , , , . Wild tension. The editors have a long story and they all read and pace, read and pace; the reporters look traumatized with fatigue. All this goes fast. (staring at the typed story) -- don't know, don't know, it feels thin-- --Christ, wish knew if we should print this-- --listen, we didn't make them do these things--once they did, it's our job to report it-- (to the reporters) --go over your sources again-- --Sloan told the Grand Jury--he answered everything they asked him-- that means there's a record somewhere-- --and the confirms--what more do you need?-- (whirling to ) --listen, love this country, you think want to bring it down?--'m not some goddamn zany, was a hawk-- --Harry, weren't you just arguing the opposite way?-- --maybe 'm tense-- --well shit, we oughtta be tense-- we're about to accuse Mr. Haldeman who only happens to be the second most important man in America of conducting a criminal conspiracy from inside the White House-- (beat) --it would be nice if we were right-- (to the reporters) --you double-checked both sources?-- They nod. --Bernstein, are you sure on this story? Absolutely-- (to ) --what about you?-- --'m sure-- --'m not sure, it still feels thin-- (looks at ) (to and , after a puse) --get another source. Now quickly : and huddling outside 's office. How many fucking sources they think we got?-- --Deep Throat won't confirm-- never thought he was scared of anyone, but he's scared of Haldeman. know a guy in the Justice Department who was around the Grand Jury. (looks at ) --We got twenty minutes to deadline-- And as he speaks : talking softly from a relatively private phone in the newsroom. The voice of the lawyer is also whispered and scared to death. ' (..) (barely audible) ...You shouldn't ever call me like this, Carl... Will you confirm that Haldeman was mentioned by Sloan to the Grand Jury? ' (..) ... won't say anything about Haldeman... not ever... (desperate) All right--listen--it's against the law if you talk about the Grand Jury, right? But you don't have to say a thing--'ll count to ten--if the story's wrong, hang up before get there--if it's stay on the line till after, got it? (..) Hang up, right? Right, right--, counting: one, two-- (he inhales deeply) --three, four, five, six-- (now he's starting to get excited) --seven, eight-- (inhales deeply) --nine, ten, thank you. (..) You've got it straight now? Everything ? (on a note of triumph) Yeah! And on that shout : -- : "" "" : On the record let me say just this: the story is totally untrue.

Desperate, tired, stunned, confused; there is nothing to say. : glaring at them. ... then : in the rain, and : retreats down the hall. and , soaked, chase after him. --'ll deny everything--everything-- never talked to you about Haldeman-- never talked to you about anything-- 'm not talking to you now-- --what went wrong?-- --for Chrissakes just tell that-- --fuck you fuck you fuck you-- And he tears into an office, slams the door and as we hear it lock-- : . My reasons are as follows: (1) it is a complicated long scene to put down; (2) we are terribly late in our story; (3) it would mean, here, two hours into the movie, we are bringing in an entirely new character; the agent's head to whom they go, and think that is unnecessary and confusing; and (4) most important, think the characters have been abused enough in this version--we have added the Sedam scene and they are berated more in this version by the people before things turn. (5) Finally, all this can show in reality is that they are desperate, and would rather let the actors give that to us. feel that it would be a genuine error at this time in the flick to go into the convolutions of how it's bad manners for a reporter to burn a source, if we've got anything going by this point, can't conceive of much an audience will be less interested in than the reporters misbehaving. However, if the scene is requested next time through, shall be only too happy to oblige. What would like to do is cut from the saying ""fuck you fuck you fuck you"" and locking his door to the following: and walking in the rain. It's pouring as they leave Headquarters and they are in anguish. (after a while) Woodward? Hmm? What was the mistake? Do you think it's been rigged, all along the way, leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered? They couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone, you know what that means? (nods) Only everything... They are soaked, Nearby is a garbage can, they grab papers, hold them over their heads, start to walk. Now-- The papers they grabbed were the Post front page. (This happened.) And as they walked, the Haldeman story was on their heads. on the reporters walking miserably through the rain. Now-- : . tremendous pall has settled on the city room.

What's this? My non-denial denial. We're not printing a retraction? : --. He is thoughtful for a while. Then, spinning around, staring out towards the newsroom: Fuck it, let's stand by the boys.

You build from the outer edges and you go step by step. If you shoot too high and miss, then everybody feels more secure. You've put the investigation back months. We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong? You'll have to find that out, won't you?-- : exploding. --'m tired of your chickenshit games-- don't want hints, want what you know! : . He blinks for a moment. Then he begins to whisper. It was a Haldeman operation--the whole business--he ran the money, but he was insulated, you'll have to find out how-- takes a breath, nods. --wait-- (almost a smile) --there's more... And from his weathered face : walking up to his apartment house later that night. He sees, and then we see, , asleep at the front door. He comes awake as approaches. We gotta go see Bradlee--'ll fill you in in the car. : . It's a house with a lawn and from somewhere there is the of dogs barking. You couldn't have told me over the phone? : and moving up the walk to . We can't trust the phones, not anymore. Deep Throat says so. As beckons for him to move out into the lawn-- We can't talk inside either? (headshake) Electronic surveillance. : . It's October now. You can see their breaths as they speak. finally got through to Sloan--it was all a misunderstanding that we had: he would have told the Grand Jury about Haldeman, he was ready to, only nobody on the Grand Jury asked him the goddamn question. So guess you could say that we screwed up, but we weren't wrong. Anything else from Mr. Throat? Mitchell started the cover-up early, everyone is involved in the cover- up, all the way to the top. The whole .. intelligence community is mixed in with the covert activities. The extent of it is incredible. (little pause) And people's lives are in danger, maybe including ours. : . He nods again, starts walking the two reporters back toward 's car. He's wrong on that last, we're not in the least danger, because nobody gives a shit--what was that Gallup Poll result? Half the country's never even heard the word Watergate. : as the three approach. Look, you're both probably a little tired, right? (They nod) You should be, you've been under a lot of pressure. So go home, have a nice hot bath, rest up fifteen minutes if you want before you get your asses back in gear-- (louder now) --because we're under a lot of pressure, too, and you put us there-- not that want it to worry you-- nothing's riding on you except the First Amendment of the Constitution plus the freedom of the press plus the reputation of a hundred-year-old paper plus the jobs of the two thousand people who work there-- (still building) --but none of that counts as much as this: you fuck up again, 'm gonna lose my temper. (pause; softer) promise you, you don't want me to lose my temper. (shooing them off) Move-move-move--what have you done for me tomorrow...? And as they get back into the car-- : -- and it's empty pretty much, except at their desks sit and , typing away.

Although 'm a Republican, would like to state in a pure bipartisan spirit tht the greatest political scandal of this campaign is the brazen manner in which, without benefit of clergy, the Washington Post has set up housekeeping with the McGovern campaign... ..

Fortunately, the American public is too smart to be fooled by... have been informed reliably by John Dean that no one connected with the White House... (coming in, overlapping) It is only our pathetic Post that deliberately tries to infuse the Watergate caper with a seriousness far beyond those shenanigans that have been the stock trade of political pranksters ever since... and work on. And now, as the voices continue condemning, we see them--all the President's men-- as their faces flash on the screen for an instant--only these aren't fashion portraits we're looking at, these are the mug shots of the men taken when they went to jail and they flash on, the mug shots and the name and across each the word .

The grows stronger--there could be a storm. pays no attention to what's going on outside as he continues to type. He's the hero of what follows. Forty-two, he's got a good face, one with a certain mileage to it. We are not, in other words, looking at a virgin. He's been a novelist for eighteen years and for half that time, the most recent half, a remarkably successful one. He pauses for a moment, intently, as if trying to stare a hole in the paper. Now his fingers fly, and there's another burst of . He studies what he's written, then-- : , as he rolls it out of the machine, puts it on the table, prints, in almost childlike letters, these words: : at the rear of the table.

He is, just for a brief moment, moved. : across the room. goes to it, opens it and pulls something out from inside: a battered red leather briefcase. Now he takes his manuscript, carefully opens the briefcase, gently puts the manuscript inside. He closes it, and the way he handles it, he might almost be handling a child. Now he crosses over, opens the champagne, pours himself a single glass, lights the one cigarette with the lone match-- there is a distinct feeling of ritual about this. He inhales deeply, makes a toasting gesture, then drinks, smokes, smiles. , then-- : - --exiting his cabin. He stops, makes a snowball, throws it, hitting a sign. Still got it. He throws a suitcase into the trunk of his '65 and, holding his leather case, he hops into the car and drives away. : that reads ""Silver Creek Lodge."" Behind the sign is the hotel itself--old, desolate. Now the '65 Mustang comes out of the garage, guns ahead toward the sign.

Now they're starting to close. The man is dying. Motionless, he still clutches the battered briefcase. . Then-- : The in Paul's hands as he sits at a desk. (..) What's that?

The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million. Marcia, please. No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her. Marcia, you know started ""Misery"" on a lark. Do look like a guy who writes romance novels? Do sound like Danielle Steel? It was a one- time shot and we got lucky. never meant it to become my life. And if hadn't gotten rid of her now, 'd have ended up writing her forever. (touches his briefcase) For the first time in fifteen years, think 'm really onto something here. 'm glad to hear that, Paul, really am. But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, ""Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can finally write what we've always wanted: An esoteric, semi- autobiographical character study. (passionately) Marcia, why are you doing this to me? Don't you know 'm scared enough? Don't you think remember how nobody gave a shit about my first books? You think 'm dying to go back to shouting in the wilderness? (beat) 'm doing this because have to. (Marcia is stopped) Now, 'm leaving for Colorado to try to finish this and want your good thoughts--because if can make it work ... (beat) might just have something that want on my tombstone.

For a moment, it's hard to tell if it's a man or woman-- --not to let the cat out of the bag or anything, but it is, very much, a woman. Her name is and she is close to Paul's age.

How long...? You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay. (relieved) My name is Annie Wilkes and 'm-- --my number one fan. And now the gibberish words make sense. That's right. 'm also a nurse.

Your legs just sing grand opera when you move, don't they? (Paul says nothing, but his pain is clear) It's not going to hurt forever, Paul, promise you. Will be able to walk? Of course you will. And your arm will be fine, too. Your shoulder was dislocated pretty badly, but finally popped it back in there. (proudly) But what 'm most proud of is the work did on those legs. Considering what had around the house, don't think there's a doctor who could have done any better. And now suddenly she flicks off the blankets, uncovering his body. : , staring, stunned at the bottom half of his body as we : ' .

You have a compound fracture of the tibia in both legs, and the fibula in the left leg is fractured too. could hear the bones moving, so it's best for your legs to remain immobile.

Then-- : ' . We're back in 's office in New York. The office looks just the same, posters and manuscripts all over. But she doesn't. She holds the phone and she is fidgety, insecure.

Whichever one's not busy. : ...with a view of the mountains. sits at a desk, by himself, holding the phone. In his sixties, he's still as bright, fast and sassy as he was half-a-lifetime ago. Never mind what his name is, everyone calls him . 'm pretty sure they 're both not busy, Ms. Sindell, since they're both me. also happen to be President of the Policeman's Benefit Association, Chairman of the Patrolman's Retirement Fund, and if you need a good fishing guide, you could do a lot worse; call me Buster, everybody does, what can do for you? : in her office. She pushes the speakerphone, gets up, paces; she's very hesitant when she speaks about Paul. Almost embarrassed-- 'm a literary agent, and feel like a fool calling you, but think one of my clients, Paul Sheldon, might be in some kind of trouble. Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer? Yes. He's your client, huh? Yes, he is. : ' He rolls a penny across the back of one hand--he's very good at it, doesn't even look while he does it. People sure like those Misery books. 'm sure you know Paul's been going to the Silver Creek Lodge for years to finish his books. Yeah, understand he's been up here the last six weeks. Not quite. just called, and they said he checked out five days ago. Isn't that a little strange? don't know. Does he always phone you when he checks out of hotels? : , really embarrassed now. No, no, of course not. It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him, and when he's got a book coming out, he usually keeps in touch. So when there was no word from him... You think he might be missing? (shakes her head) hate that made this call--tell me 'm being silly. : . He nods as a enters, carrying lunch. It's his wife, . She begins putting the food down on a table for the both of them. Just a little over-protective, maybe. (beat) Tell you what--nothing's been reported out here-- (he puts Paul Sheldon's name with a ? on a 3 x 5 ) --but 'll put his name through our system. (he tacks the card to a bulletin board) And if anything turns up, 'll call you right away. : . She smiles, a genuine sense of relief. appreciate that. Thanks a lot. : 'bye, Ms. Sindell. As he hangs up-- We actually got a phone call. Busy morning. (smiles) Work, work, work. (gives her a hug) Virginia? When was that blizzard? Four or five days ago. Why? : . The penny flies across the back of his hand. He doesn't look at it, stares instead out the window at the mountains. (a beat) ...no reason... for a moment. : ' ' (soft) guess it was kind of a miracle... you finding me... 's soft, sweet laughter is heard. She stands over him, finishing shaving him with a very sharp straight razor. She wears what we will come to know as her regular costume--plain wool skirts, grey cardigan sweaters. No, it wasn't a miracle at all... in a way, was following you. Following me? concentrates on shaving him with great care; she has wonderful, strong hands. (explaining, normally) Well, it wasn't any secret to me that you were staying at the Silver Creek, seeing as how 'm your number- one fan and all. Some nights 'd just tool on down there, sit outside and look up at the light in your cabin-- (gently moves his head back, exposing his neck; this next is said with total sincerity, almost awe) and 'd try to imagine what was going on in the room of the world's greatest writer. Say that last part again, didn't quite hear-- (smiles) Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck-- (shaving away) Well, the other afternoon was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming. didn't know it was going to be a big storm. Lucky for you, did. (pauses) Lucky for me too. Because now you're alive and you can write more books. Oh, Paul, 've read everything of Yours, but the Misery novels... : : know them all by heart, Paul, all eight of them. love them so. : , looking at her. There's something terribly touching about her now. You're very kind... And you're very brilliant, and you must be a good man, or you could never have created such a wondrous, loving creature as Misery Chastain. (runs her fingers over his cheek) Like a baby. (smiles) All done. (starts to dab away the last bits of soap) starts cleaning up. When do you think the phone lines'll be back up? have to call my daughter, and should call New York and let my agent know 'm breathing. It shouldn't be too much longer. (gently) Once the roads are open, the lines'll be up in no time. If you give me their numbers, 'll keep trying them for you. (suddenly almost embarrassed) Could ask you a favor? (Paul nods) noticed in your case there was a new Paul Sheldon book and... (hesitant) and wondered if maybe... (her voice trails off) You want to read it? (quietly) If you wouldn't mind. have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck. (genuinely thrilled) You'll never realize what a rare treat you've given me. : . His eyes close briefly, he grimaces. : , watching him, concerned. She glances at her watch. Boy, it's like clockwork, the way your pain comes--'ll get you your Novril, Paul. Forgive me for prattling away and making you feel all oogy. She turns and goes out of the room. : , watching her. What's your new book called? don't have a title yet. What's it about? (fast) It's crazy, but don't really know, mean haven't written anything but ""Misery"" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title.

Nothing unusual about Mr. Sheldon's leaving, Buster--you can tell by the champagne. Maybe you can, Libby. No, see, he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go. Then he'd pay up and be out the door. No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary? (head shake) don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him. So do ... 'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now. 'm sure you're right. But you can tell he's not sure at all as we : : ' . He lies in bed. Sun comes in the lone window. sits on the bed, a large bowl of soup in her hands, feeding him. (almost shy about this) know 'm only forty pages into your book, but... She stops, fills the spoon up again. But what? Nothing. No, what is it? Oh, it's ridiculous, who am to make a criticism to someone like you? can take it, go ahead. Well, it's brilliantly written, but then everything you write is brilliant. Pretty rough so far. (a burst) The swearing, Paul. (beat) There, said it. The profanity bothers you? It has no nobility. Well, these are slum kids, was a slum kid, everybody talks like that. : . She holds the soup bowl in one hand, the muddy-colored beef barley soup close to spilling. They do not.

Sometimes get so worked up. Can you ever forgive me? Here... She hands him his pills and starts to clean the soup off the coverlet. Then she makes the sweetest smile. love you, Paul. (more embarrassed than ever) Your mind. Your creativity--that's all meant. Flustered, she turns away as we-- : . Piles of snow all around but it's been ploughed enough so it's driveable. : coming into view. Up ahead is the sign we've already seen: ""Curved Road, Next 13 Miles."" : : Virginia is driving while Buster intently studies the terrain. He reaches for a large thermos, pours some coffee, offers it to her. She shakes her head. He begins to sip it. This sure is fun. She puts her hand on his leg. (removing it) Virginia, when you're in this car, you're not my wife, you're my deputy. Well, this deputy would rather be home under the covers with the Sheriff. : . Suddenly, it goes into a little icy spin--she fights it back under control. : (suddenly) Stop--stop right here. What? What is it? : , skidding, slowing, stopping. get out, go to the edge of the road. Mountains of snow. Nothing much else visible. Then Buster points. Look at that broken branch there... : , seeing it, unconvinced. Could be the weight of the snow. Could be--or a rotten branch or a mountain lion could have landed on it. Could be a lot of things. He steps off the road, starts down. : , watching him, worried--it's very slippery. : , graceful, in great shape, navigating down easily. : that the car ran into. reaches it, studies it. : , staring out after him--she can't see him because the drop is both too steep and covered with trees and mounds of snow. Anything down there? ' (..) Yeah. An enormous amount of snow. : . He's moved away from the tree now, going toward where the Mustang is buried. : with the Mustang inside. : , making his way closer to it, closer, staring around. : . Nothing to be seen--everything is covered with mountains of snow. You could have a house down there and not be able to see it. Just glaring white. : , angry, frustrated, turning around and around and : from another angle, from behind the mound with the Mustang inside--and out of his sight, glistening in the sun, a bit of the door protrudes. But, of course, Buster can't see it. , in a sour mood, staring around as the edge of the door continues to glisten. : , on the road as Buster makes his way back up, still ticked. (they move to the car) You really think Sheldon's out there? Hope not--if he is, he's dead. Let's go to the newspaper office. As they get in the car-- --it's Annie in her Jeep--neither she nor Buster notice each other. : ' The door opens and enters. Oh, 'm sorry. didn't mean to wake you. It's fine.

He said as long as there's no infection, you're not in any danger, and as soon as the road to the hospital is open, they'll send an ambulance for you. The phones are working? Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. called that agent of yours. (soft now) Oh, Paul, peeked at the very beginning.

No. No, it isn't, it's-- (halts) --oh pooh, can't think of any words. Would ""great"" be insulting? can live with ""great."" He starts, with effort, to eat.

'll cherish it anyway. As signs the book: don't mean to pry, but 've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. And said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that. Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines. knew it. knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that? You'd be amazed at what some people will believe. He finishes the autograph, hands the book back to her. Thank you so much.

Yeah, that and Misery's Child--those are the only two divine things ever in this world... watches as the pig skitters out of the room with in pursuit, happily imitating the pig. Woink! Whoink!

That was hen first discovered Misery. She made me so happy. She made me forget all my problems. (She smiles now) 'Course, suppose you had a little something to do with that too. There is a peeing sound. Yeah, well... He is embarrassed.

But it would take a pretty special guy to make me want to go down the aisle again. Well, it's not something you should enter into lightly. It boils down to respect. People just don't respect the institution of marriage any more. They have no sense of real commitment. : , attempting to smile. There is not much he can say to this.

No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all. (screaming) She slipped away? She slipped away? She didn't just slip away. You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it. You murdered my Misery. And now she has lifted a chair--it's heavy but she's very strong--and she raises it and turns on Paul, and it's high above her head, and realizes that this might be it, she might shatter him with it, crunch his skull--and that's just what she seems she's about to do--and then she swings it, not against him but against the wall, and it shatters and she's panting from the effort as she turns on him again, her voice surprisingly soft. thought you were good, Paul, but you're not good, you're just another lying old dirty birdie and don't think better be around you for awhile. (she crosses to the door, then stops) And don't even think about anybody coming for you, not the doctors, not your agent, not your family--because never called them. Nobody knows you're here.

All he hears are the in the mountains. After a few beats, he takes a deep breath and then begins his greatest effort of all: to force his body out of bed, to make it move. He's still weak from what he's endured, but that's not the main thing: it's the pain. Any attempt at movement and his legs scream. He sags back, lies there still a moment. Slowly he tries to maneuver his body off the bed. He rolls over onto his stomach, then tries to lower himself onto the floor by moving down head first. His good arm hits the floor, and he is able to hold himself up but, realizing there is no way to get out of bed without causing tremendous pain, he girds himself and flings himself out of bed and comes crashing to the floor. The pain is excruciating. After he regains his composure, he slowly crawls toward the door. He reaches up and tries the handle. It is, in fact, locked. He awkwardly tries to slam up against the door, but it is much too painful and to no avail. He crawls back over to the bed, realizes there's no way to climb back in, then grabs the blanket from the bed, wraps it around himself, and closes his eyes. : ' . . He sits alone at his desk on the telephone, staring at the Rocky Mountain Gazette spread in front of him. : ' In a prominent spot on the top is what is most likely a book- jacket photo of Paul.

This last was said by Annie, out of focus, and for a moment, she stays that way-- : , -- is standing by the bed. It is dusk. She wears a dark blue dress and a hat with a sprig of flowers. Her eyes are bright and vivacious--the fact is, this is the prettiest has ever looked. What are you doing on the floor? (crossing to the bed) It's my fault. If 'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened. Here, let me help you back in.

But this time thought clearly. asked God about you and God said "" delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way."" Show me the way? Yes. She exits and re-enters wheeling something toward his bed. It's a charcoal barbecue, the kind you use in summer for cooking hamburgers. She holds several items in her arms: a box of Diamond Blue Tip wooden matches, a can of lighter fluid. And most noticeably, Paul's manuscript. : . He watches, mute, as she takes off the grill, puts the manuscript into the barbecue itself where the charcoal goes, spritzes it with lighter fluid. The grill is close enough to the bed for him to reach out and drop a match. When mentioned a snack, was thinking more along the lines of a cheese and crackers kind of thing. : , looking at him. Paul, this is no time for jokes. You must rid the world of this filth. She hands him the box of kitchen matches. You want me to burn my book? (she nods) Yes. You want me to burn my book? know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best. This isn't difficult, my agent's made dozens of copies. There's gonna be an auction on this, and every publishing house in New York is reading it now. So if you want me to burn it, fine. You're not ridding the world of anything. : , watching him.

And ever since you've never made any copies because you're superstitious--it's why you always come back to the Silver Creek Lodge. You told that story to Merv Griffin eleven years ago. You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split. (pause) God knows you're entitled to it. Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values. You're right. You're right. don't know what was thinking. 'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published.

This is a very big day for you, Paul. Here. You just sit tight, and 'll set everything up. exits. : , quickly shoving the Novril into the mattress. Set what up? That's the big surprise. Your new studio--after all, writers do need a place to work. Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think 'd write? Oh, but Paul! (flushed) don't think, know! Now that you've gotten rid of that nasty manuscript, you can go back to doing what you're great at-- (beat) --you're going to write a new novel-- your greatest achievement ever-- Misery's Return. : .

The sky is innocent of clouds. There's a green forest climbing the flank of the nearest mountain. plot of open ground between the house and the mountain. neat red barn where the livestock stay.

(gesturing to the box of paper) You did great, except there's just one little thing-- can't work with this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it smudges. Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long-grained mimeo. But mine cost the most so don't see how it could smudge. (quickly taking a sheet of paper, making a pencil mark on it) 'mere, 'll show you. As she approaches, he rubs his thumb over the pencil mark. (looking at it) Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating? thought you'd be interested. 'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written. Thank you for thinking of me. (She can be so charming when she wants) Anything else can get while 'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers? No, just the paper will be fine. (suddenly very agitated) Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, 'll bring back the whole store for you. Annie, what's the matter? What's the matter? 'll tell you what's the matter. go out of my way for you. do everything to try and make you happy. feed you, clean you, dress you. And what thanks do get?

(amazed) What do you know, it actually works. : , trying to get out of the room--but it's a bitch because in order to get to the lock he had to move the wheelchair up to the door and in order to get out, he's got to maneuver it out of the way of the door and every turn of the chair's wheels is an effort for him. He works at it and works at it, but his energy is failing him. He's pale, perspiring. Finally he succeeds, barely forces his way into the hall. : , in the hallway outside. He looks around for a phone. Doesn't see one. He wheels himself over to the front door, tries it. It's locked from the outside. What a surprise. He looks off into the living room, and... : : , wheeling into the living room. Dark red predominates. It's a musty room.

As begins to wheel as fast as he can toward the phone-- : as at last grabs for it, gets it, punches the ""operator"" button-- Operator... (nothing) ...... (wildly frustrated) ...Shit! He shakes the phone. It's terribly light. He picks it up, turns it over--it's hollow, just a shell of a telephone. He stares at it for a long moment, shaking his head, the disappointment plain. You crazy bitch... He puts the phone back on the table. : . . Annie exits the store, carrying new paper, hops into her Cherokee and drives off. : , as enters. He looks around. It's stuffed with heavy, graceless furniture as well as lots of coffee tables covered with knickknacks. As he, with effort, wheels across it-- : shelf of . books.

He continues his slow way across the room and : . Out in the hallway, on his way toward the kitchen, notices a door to his right. He wheels over and surprisingly it opens. However, this is not a door to the outside of the house, only a storage pantry. He looks around--nothing but canned goods, potato chips, cereals and large plastic Coke containers, etc. Just as he is about to close the door, he notices an open cardboard box. He opens the flap and sees all kinds of prescription drugs. Among them are a couple of strips of Novril encapsulated in blisters. He grabs them and stuffs them into his sweatpants. Now he closes the pantry door and heads to the kitchen. : As approaches it. He starts to wheel his way in, but he has trouble. He backs up slightly, wheels forward again-- --but the door is too narrow for the chair to fit through. He pounds his fists on the chair arm, staring as we : . It's at the far end of the kitchen leading to the outside. It seems somehow less formidable than the front door did. The windows around the kitchen are barred. : , staring at the kitchen door-- --then without warning, he makes his move, starting to lower himself out of the chair gently to the floor-- --only it doesn't work that way. It's too awkward, he doesn't have the strength to maneuver properly-- --and his body tilts awkwardly out of the chair, slams hard against the hard floor. : , crying out in pain as he lands. He lies there for a moment. Little droplets of sweat are on his forehead now. He is hurting. He closes his eyes, gathering strength-- --and then slowly, very slowly, inch by inch, he moves his body across the floor toward the kitchen door. : . It's still a long way away. : , ignoring his pain, his awkwardness, making his body move. : . Closer now. : , growing pale, but he won't stop, and now the door is just ahead of him, and with his good arm he reaches out and up and grabs the doorknob-- : . Locked solid. : : .

Then, he takes his paper container and empties the contents of all the pills into it, then places it under the mattress. Now, what to do with the empty capsules.

Oh, Paul, when Ian realized that the reason they'd buried Misery alive was because the bee sting had put her in that temporary coma-- : , in a fervor. --and when Gravedigger Wilkes remembered how thirty years earlier, the same thing had happened to Lady Evelyn-Hyde-- (hands clasped) --and then old Dr. Cleary deduced that Misery must be Lady Evelyn-Hyde's long-lost daughter because of the rarity of deadly bee-stings--my heart just leapt. : , watching her.

Have to wait. (plead ing) Not even a hint? Paul shakes his head. : , spinning around the room like a happy child. Misery's alive! Misery's alive. Oh, it's so romantic--this whole house is going to be filled with romance. 'm going to put on my Liberace records-- (Stops, looks at Paul) --you do like Liberace, don't you? (quickly) Whenever he played Radio City, who do you think was right there in the front row? 'm going to play my records all day --to inspire you--he's my all-time favorite. And with that, she starts to leave. Annie? She stops at the door. Would you have dinner with me tonight? She can't speak. To celebrate Misery's return. couldn't have done it without you. Oh, Paul.

Give my best to Denise. Bye. (looking through the books; all paperback Misery novels) Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot. Virginia, 'm flattered you think got that much energy. just figured if can't find Paul Sheldon, at least can find out what he wrote about.

Finally: 've never had meatloaf this good, what do you do to it? My secret is only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, mix in some Spam with the ground beef. Oh. (pause) You can't get this in a restaurant in New York. After another pause: Annie, think we should have a toast. toast? Yes, to Misery. Let me pour you some more wine. Paul pours more of the Gallo wine, then raises his glass. To Misery. Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles? Oh, don't know. think so. 'll go look. She exits into the kitchen. quickly pulls the packet filled with Novril powder from his pants. He empties it into her glass of wine, stuffs the empty packet back into his pants, talking the whole time: Did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair? Oh, you. just picked things up over the years. Well, it certainly says you. You really think so? Absolutely. Listen, if you can't find any, it's okay. just thought it might be nice. re-enters with a candle. Are you kidding?

In trying to right the situation, she places her glass back down, and as she reaches for the candle, she knocks over her glass, spilling the wine. (wiping up the spilled wine with her napkin) Oh, God, what have done? 'm so sorry, Paul. ruined your beautiful toast. Will you ever forgive me? Here, let me pour another one.

Eventually, you'll come to accept the idea of being here. Paul, do you know about the early days at the Kimberly Diamond Mine? Do you know what they did to the native workers who stole diamonds? Don't worry, they didn't kill them. That would be like junking a Mercedes just because it had a broken spring-- no, if they caught them they had to make sure they could go on working, but they also had to make sure they could never run away. The operation was called hobbling. And with that, she reaches down out of sight and comes up holding a 16-inch piece of 4 x 4 wood. Annie, whatever you're thinking about, don't do it. : . She wedges the 4 x 4 firmly between his legs, just above the ankles, secures it and adjusts his feet. Now don't fuss, Paul. Why would run away?

It's one of those wonderful spots that stocks pretty much everything in what seems like complete disarray. Buster goes to the coffee urn behind the counter, helps himself. He speaks to the guy who sits behind the counter nearby; these two have known each other forever. Hey, Pete. Buster. Answer me a couple things? If can. Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books? We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days. You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you? Are you kidding? Every time that fella writes a book, she makes me set aside the first copy. opens the cash register, drops his coffee money inside, closes the register. Has she been buying any odd things lately?

Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner, you make me burn my book, you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles...

But before Paul can answer, there's the sound of a .

Random House-Knopf-Taschen is etched on the wall in large gold letters. An old woman enters carrying a tattered manuscript, maybe a thousand pages. She seems haunted, hollow-eyed, sickly. The young receptionist, dressed in a shiny, stretchy one-piece pantsuit, looks up. 		 	Oh, hi. 		 		(apologetically) 	Hi, was in the neighborhood and thought 	'd see -- 		 	 think he's in a conference. 	Unfortunately. 'm really sorry. 		 	Would you just try him? You never know. 	As long as 'm here. You never know. 		 	Of course. Please have a seat. The old woman smiles and sits, the bulky manuscript on her lap. She stares politely straight ahead. 		 (') 		(quietly into headset) 	It's her -- know, but couldn't you just 	-- Yes, know, but -- know, but she's 	old and it would be a nice -- Yes, sorry. 		(to old woman) 	'm sorry, ma'am, he's not in right now. 	It's a crazy time of year for us. The receptionist gestures toward a Christmas tree in the corner. Its ornaments are holograms. 		 	This book -- It's essential that people 	read it because -- 		(gravely, patting the 		 manuscript) 	-- It's the truth. And only know it. 		 		(nodding sympathetically) 	Maybe after the holidays then. . - The old woman carries her manuscript haltingly down a subway hall. She stops to catch her breath, then continues and passes several archway with letters printed above them. When she arrives at one topped by an , she slips a card in a slot. plastic molded chair drops into the archway. She sits in the chair; it rises. . - The woman is still in the chair as it slips gracefully into a line of chairs shooting through a glass tube. The other chairs are peopled with commuters. We stay with the woman as she and the others travel over New York City in the tube. There are hundreds of these commuter tubes crisscrossing the skyline. The woman glances at the manuscript in her lap. It's called: Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind This serves as the movie's opening title. The other credits follow, as the old woman studies commuters in passing tubes. Their faces are variously harsh and sad and lonely and blank. . - : Every doctor's office waiting room: chairs against the wall, magazines on end tables, a sad-looking potted plant, generic seascape paintings on the walls. The receptionist, Mary, 25, can be seen typing in the reception area. Behind her are shelves and shelves of medical files. The door opens and Clementine enters. She's in her early thirties, zaftig in a faux fur winter coat over an orange hooded sweatshirt. She's decidedly funky and has blue hair. Mary looks up. 		 	May help you? 		 		(approaching reception area) 	Yeah, hi, have a one o'clock with Dr. 	Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski. 		 	Yes, please have a seat. He'll be right 	with you. Clementine sits. She looks tired, maybe hungover. She picks up a magazine at random and thumbs without interest. . - Mary pads down the hallway. She knocks on a closed door. 		 (..) 	Yes? Mary opens the door, peeks in. Howard Mierzwiak, 40's, professional, dry, sits behind his desk studying some papers. 		 	Howard, your one o'clock. 		 		(not looking up) 	Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in. She smiles and nods. It's clear she's in love. It's equally clear that Mierzwiak doesn't have a clue. Mary turns to leave. 		 (') 		(looking up) 	Mary... 		 		(turning back) 	Yes? 		 	Order me a pastrami for after? 		 	Cole slaw, ice tea? 		 		(nodding) 	Thanks. 		 	Welcome, Howard. She smiles and heads down the hall. Stan, 30's, tall, spindly, and earnest in a lab coat pops out of a doorway. 		 	Boo. 		 	Hi. She glances back nervously at Mierzwiak's open door. 		 	Barely seen you all morning, kiddo. He leans in to kiss her. She cranes her neck to keep him off. 		 		(reprimanding whisper) 	Stan... c'mon... 		 	Sorry. just -- 		 		(somewhat guiltilly) 	It's just...y'know... mean... 		 	 know.

(at Mierzwiak's office) 	Here we are. Mierzwiak steps out from behind his desk. 		 	Ms. Kruczynski, please come in. Clementine enters the office. Mary smiles at Mierzwiak and closes the door, leaving them alone. . - Mierzwiak directs Clementine to a chair next to a coffee table and a conspicuously placed box of tissues. Mierzwiak sits across from her. He smiles. 		 	How are you today? 		 	Okay, guess. 		 		(nodding sympathetically) 	Well, why don't you tell me what's going 	on? Do you mind if turn this on? He indicates a tape recorder. 		 	 don't care. He turns it on, smiles at her, gestures for her to begin. 		 (') 	Well, 've been having a bad time of it 	with um, my boyfriend, guess. 		 	You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you 	guess you're having a bad time with hm? 		 	What? No. don't like the term 	boyfriend. It's so gay. Mierzwiak nods. He's attentive, pleasant, and neutral throughout. 		 (') 	Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, 	anyway, it's been rough with him... 	whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My 	significant other... heh heh. And 	guess on a certain level, want to break 	it off, but feel... y'know... it's like 	this constant questioning and re 	questioning. Do end it? Should give 	it more time?

The thing that 	keep coming back to is, 'm not getting 	any younger, want to have a baby... at 	some point... maybe... right? So then 	think should settle -- which is not 	necessarily the best word -- mean, he's 	a good guy. It's not really settling. 	Then think maybe 'm just a victim of 	movies, y'know? That have some 	completely unrealistic notion of what a 	relationship can be. But then think, 	no, this is what really want, so 	should allow myself the freedom to go out 	and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? 	But then think he is a good guy and... 	It's complicated. 'know? 		 	 think know. think we can help. Why 	don't you start by telling me about your 	relationship. Everything you can think 	of. Everything about him. Everything 	about you. And we'll take it from there. She nods, thinks. 		 	Um, well, he's a fucking tidy one -- . : The platform is crowded with business commuters. Joel is among them. He is in his 30's, gaunt, and holding a briefcase. The platform across the tracks from him is empty. Suddenly he turns and makes his way through the crowd. He climbs the stairs, crosses the overpass to the empty platform. Soon an almost empty train pulls up to that platform. Joel gets on and watches the business commuters through the dirty window as his train pulls out of the station. . - Joel talks on a phone. The wind howls around him. He tries to shield the mouthpiece as he talks. 		 	Hi, Cindy. Joel. Listen, 'm not 	feeling well this morning. No. Food 	poisoning, think. Sorry it took me so 	long to call in, but 've been vomiting. . - Joel wanders the windy, empty beach, with his briefcase. He passes an old man with a metal detector. They nod at each other. Later: Joel looks out at the ocean. Later: Joel sits on a rock and pulls out a notebook. He opens it and writes with a gloved hand. 		 	January 13th, 2006. Today skipped work 	and took the train out to Montauk. 		(thinks) 	It's cold. 		(thinks some more) 	The sky is gray. 		(thinks some more) 	 don't know what else to say. Nothing 	happens. Nothing changes. saw Naomi 	last night. We had sex. It was weird to 	fall into our old familiar sex life so 	easily. Like no time has passed. After 	two years apart suddenly we're talking 	about getting together again. guess 	that's good. He has no other thoughts. He glances up, spots a female figure in the distance, walking in his direction. She stands out against the gray in a fluorescent orange hooded sweatshirt. It's Clementine. He watches her for a bit, then as she nears, he goes back to his writing, or at least pretends to. Once she passed, he watches her walk away. She stops and stares out at the ocean. Joel writes. 		 (..) (') 	If 'm constitutionally incapable of 	making eye-contact with a woman don't 	know. guess 'd better get back to 	Naomi. Later: Joel walks up near the beach houses closed for the season. He peeks cautiously in a dark window. Later: Joel digs into the sand with a stick. . - It's a local tourist place, but off-season empty. Joel sits in a booth and eats a grilled cheese sandwich and a bowl of tomato soup. An elderly couple drink coffee at the counter. Clementine enters, looks around, takes off her hood. Joel glances at her bright blue hair. She picks an empty booth and sits. Joel studies her discreetly. The waitress approaches her with a coffee pot. 		 	Coffee? 		 	God, yes. You've saved my life! The waitress pours the coffee. 		 	You know what you want yet? 		 		(laughing) 	Ain't that the question of the century. The waitress is not amused. 		 (') 	You got grilled cheese and tomato soup? 		 	Yeah. We're having a run on it. The waitress heads to the grill. Clementine fishes in her bag, brings the coffee cup under the table for a moment, pours something in, then brings the cup back up. 		 		(calling) 	And some cream, please. Clementine looks around the place. Her eyes meet Joel's before he is able to look away. She smiles vaguely. He looks embarrassed, then down at his journal. Clementine pulls a book from her purse and starts to read. Joel glances up, tries to see the cover. It's blue. He can't read the title. . - Joel stares out at the ocean. Far down the beach Clementine stares at it, too. Joel glances sideways at her then back at the ocean. . - Joel sits on the bench waiting for a train. Clementine enters the platform, sees Joel, the only other person there. She waves, sort of goofily enthusiastic, playing as if they're old friends. He waves back, embarrassed. She takes a seat on a bench far down the platform. Joel stares at his hands, pulls out his journal and tries to write in order to conceal his awkwardness. . - Joel sits at the far end of the empty car and watches the slowly passing desolate terrain. After a moment the door between cars opens and Clementine enters. Joel looks up. Clementine is not looking at him; she busies herself deciding where to sit. She settles on a seat at the opposite end of the car. Joel looks out the window. He feels her watching him. The train is picking up speed. Finally: 		 		(calling over the rumble) 	Hi! Joel looks over. 		 	'm sorry. 		 	Why? 		 	Why what? 		 	Why are you sorry? just said hi. 		 	No, didn't know if you were talking to 	me, so... She looks around the empty car. 		 	Really? 		 		(embarrassed) 	Well, didn't want to assume. 		 	Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the 	leap and assume someone is talking to you 	in an otherwise empty car. 		 	Anyway. Sorry. Hi. Clementine makes her way down the aisle towards Joel. 		 	It's okay if sit closer? So don't 	have to scream. Not that don't need to 	scream sometimes, believe me. 		(pause) 	But don't want to bug you if you're 	trying to write or something. 		 	No, mean, don't know. can't really 	think of much to say probably. 		 	Oh. So... She hesitates in the middle of the car, looks back where she came from. 		 	 mean, it's okay if you want to sit down 	here. didn't mean to -- 		 	No, don't want to bug you if you're 	trying to -- 		 	It's okay, really. 		 	Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. 	 have a long trip ahead of me. 		(sits across aisle from Joel) 	How far are you going? On the train, 	mean, of course. 		 	Rockville Center. 		 	Get out! Me too! What are the odds? 		 	The weirder part is think actually 	recognize you. thought that earlier in 	the diner. That's why was looking at 	you. You work at Borders, right? 		 	Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. 	Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's 	me: book slave there for, like, five 	years now. 		 	Really? Because -- 		 	Jesus, is it five years? gotta quit 	right now. 		 	-- because go there all the time. 	don't think ever saw you before. 		 	Well, 'm there. hide in the back as 	much as is humanly possible. You have a 	cell phone? need to quit right this 	minute. 'll call in dead. 		 	 don't have one. 		 	'll go on the dole.

(pulls a strand in front of her 		 eyes, studies it) 	Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The 	color. Snappy name, huh? 		 	 like it. 		 	Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were 	wondering. 		 	Yeah. Tom Waits says it in -- 		 	Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song? 		 	 can't remember. 		 	Anyway, this company makes a whole line 	of colors with equally snappy names. Red 	Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. 	That'd be a job, coming up with those 	names. How do you get a job like that? 	That's what 'll do. Fuck the dole. 		 	 don't really know how -- 		 	Purple Haze, Pink Eraser. 		 	You think that could possibly be a full 	time job? How many hair colors could 	there be? 		 		(pissy) 	Someone's got that job. 		(excited) 	Agent Orange! came up with that one. 	Anyway, there are endless color 	possibilities and 'd be great at it. 		 	'm sure you would. 		 	My writing career! Your hair written by 	Clementine Kruczynski. 		(thought) 	The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs. 		 	You sure? That doesn't sound -- 		 	 think. Anyway, 've tried all their 	colors. More than once. 'm getting too 	old for this. But it keeps me from 	having to develop an actual personality. 	 apply my personality in a paste. You? 		 	Oh, doubt that's the case. 		 	Well, you don't know me, so... you don't 	know, do you? 		 	Sorry. was just trying to be nice. 		 	Yeah, got it. There's a silence. 		 (') 	My name's Clementine, by the way. 		 	'm Joel. 		 	No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't 	do that; you're trying to be nice. 		 	 don't know any jokes about your name. 		 	Huckleberry Hound? 		 	 don't know what that means. 		 	Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts? 		 	'm nut nuts. 		 		(singing) 	Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my 	darlin' Clementine? No? 		 	Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It 	means ""merciful"", right? 		 		(impressed) 	Yeah. Although it hardly fits. 'm a 	vindictive little bitch, truth be told. 		 	See, wouldn't think that about you. 		 		(pissy) 	Why wouldn't you think that about me? 		 	Oh. don't know. was just... don't 	know. was... You seemed nice, so -- 		 	Now 'm nice? Don't you know any other 	adjectives? There's careless and snotty 	and overbearing and argumentative... 	mumpish. 		 	Well, anyway... Sorry. They sit in silence for a while. 		 	 just don't think ""nice"" is a 	particularly interesting thing to be. The conductor enters the car. 		 	Tickets. Joel hands the conductor his ticket. The conductor punches it and hands it back. 		 	What is nice, anyway? mean, besides an 	adjective? guess it can be an adverb, 	sort of. The conductor turns to Clementine. She fishes in her bag. 		 (') 	It doesn't reveal anything. Nice is 	pandering. Cowardly. 		 (') 	And life is more interesting than that. 	Or should be. Jesus God, hope it is... 	someday. 		(to conductor) 	 know it's here. The conductor and Joel watch as she gets more agitated. 		 (') 	 don't need nice. don't need myself 	to be it and don't need anyone else to 	be it at me. 		 	Okay. 		 	Shit. Shit. know it's here. Hold on. She dumps the contents of the bag onto the seat and sifts frantically through. Joel sees the book she was reading in the diner. It's The Play by Stephen Dixon. 		 (') 	Damn it. ! 		(there it is) 	Oh. Here. She hands the conductor the tickets, smiles sweetly. He punches it, hands it back to her, and walks away. 		 	Next stop Southampton. The conductor heads into the next car. Clementine shoves stuff back into her purse. Her hands are a little shaky. She pulls a airline-sized bottle of alcohol from her pocket, opens it, and downs it. Joel is watching all of this but pretending not to. She looks out the window for a while. The train pulls into the station. The doors open. Nobody gets on. The doors close. The train pulls out. 		 	Joel? It's Joel, right? 		 	Yes? 		 	'm sorry ... yelled at you. Was it 	yelling? can't really tell. Whatever, 	'm a little out of sorts today. 		 	That's okay. 		 		(stares out window) 	My embarrassing admission is really 	like that you're nice. Right now, 	anyway. can't tell from one moment to 	the next what 'm going to like. But 	right now 'm glad you said, ""that's 	okay"" to me. That was nice of you. 		 	It's no problem. Anyway, have some 	stuff need to -- 		 	Oh, okay. Well, sure, 'll just... 		(stands, throws bag over 		 shoulder) 	Take care, then. 		 		(pulling journal from 		 briefcase) 	Probably see you at the book store. 		 		(heading toward other end of 		 car) 	Unless get that hair-color-naming job. Clementine sits and stares out the window. . - There are a few more people in the car now. Clementine has inched a few seats closer to Joel. She watches him. His head is immersed in his journal. . - It's dark out. The train is pretty crowded. Joel stares out the window. Clementine sits closer still to Joel, eyes him. . - The doors open and Joel emerges along with others. He heads to the parking lot, arrives at the car. There's a big dented scrape along the driver's side. He gets in. . - Joel drives. He passes Clementine walking. She looks cold. He considers, slows, rolls down his window. 		 	Hi. could give you a ride if you need. 		 	No, that's okay. Thanks, though. 		 	You're sure? It's cold. 		 	 don't want to take you out of your way. 		 	It's okay. 		 	Yeah? He pulls over. She climbs in. They drive. 		 	Where do you live? 		 	You're not a stalker or anything, right? 		 	Well, probably wouldn't say if were, 	but no. 		 	You can't be too careful. 've been 	stalked. 've been told 'm highly 	stalkable. don't need that. 		 	'm not a stalker. 		 		(beat) 	You know Wilmont? 		 	Yeah. 		 	Wilmont. Near the high school. Joel turns. They drive in silence. 		 (') 	Look, 'm very sorry came off sort of 	nutso. 'm not really. 		 	It's okay. didn't think you were. There's a silence. 		 	So you like bookstores, huh? 		 	 like to read. 		 	Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way. 		 	Yeah? can't remember that album very 	well. remember liking it. But -- 		 	The song's 9th and Hennepin. spent 	most of the train ride trying to 	remember. ""Till you're full of rag water 	and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill 	out/Over the side to anyone who'll 	listen."" Remember? 		 	Sort of, um... 		 	Remember? ""And you take on the dreams of 	the ones who have slept there/And 'm 	lost in the window/ hide on the 	stairway/ hang in the curtain/ sleep in 	your hat..."" 		(starts to cry) 	Oh, shit. 'm so stupid. Sorry. 		 	What? 		 	'm just a bit of a wreck. "" sleep in 	your hat"" makes me cry. 		(pointing to a house) 	Me. Joel pulls over. 		 (') 	Thanks very much. That was very nice of 	you. 		 	Well, wouldn't want to be -- 		 	Oh, geez, 'm full of shit. already 	told you that. 		(pause) 	Anyway. See Ya. Clementine opens the car door. 		 	Take care. 		 		(turning back) 	Hey, do you want to have a drink? have 	lots of drinks. And could -- 		 	Um -- 		 	Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. 'm 	embarrassed. Good night, Joel. . ' - Joel stands in the living room, somewhat nervously. He tries to calm himself by focusing on the surroundings. He looks at the books on her shelves. Clementine is in the kitchen. We see her as she passes by the doorway several times, preparing drinks and chatting. 		 	Thanks. like it, too. Been here about 	four years. It's really cheap. My 	downstairs neighbor is old so she's 	quiet, which is great. And the 	landlord's sweet, which is bizarre, but 	great, and have a little porch in the 	back, which is great, because can read 	there, and listen to my crickets and... Clementine is in the living room now with two gin and tonics. 		 (') 	Two blue ruins... Joel is looking at a framed black and white photograph of crows flying. 		 (') 	You like that? 		 	Very much. 		 	This... someone gave that to me, just 	like, recently. like it, too. like 	crows. think used to be a crow. She caws and hands Joel a drink. 		 	Thanks. That was good, that crow sound. 		 	Do you believe in that stuff? 	Reincarnation? 		 	 don't know. 		 	Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription 	on the back.

(impressed) 	Yeah. 'm not, like, a Robert Frost 	lover by any stretch. His stuff seems 	strictly grade school to me. But this 	made me cry for some reason. Maybe 	because it is grade school. 'know? 		 	It's pretty. 		 	 miss grade school. don't know why 	'm calling it grade school all of a 	sudden. When went we called it 	elementary school. But like grade 	school better. Sounds like something 	someone from the forties would call it. 	'd like to be from then. Everyone wore 	hats. Anyway, cheers! 		 	Cheers. They click glasses. Clementine giggles and takes a big gulp of her drink. Joel sips. She plops down on the couch and pulls her boots off. 		 	God, that feels so fucking good. Take 	yours off. 		 	'm fine. 		 	Yeah? Well, have a seat, anyway. Joel sits in a chair across the room. Clementine finishes her drink. 		 (') 	Ready for another? 		 	No, 'm okay for now. She heads toward the kitchen with her glass. 		 	Well, 'm ready. Put some music on. Joel crosses to the 's and studies them. 		 	What do you want to hear? 		 (..) 	You pick it. 		 	You just say. 'm not really -- 		 (..) 	 don't know! can't see them from 	here, Joel! Just pick something good. Joel studies the unfamiliar 's. He picks up Bang On a Can performing Brian Eno's Music for Airports to look at. Clementine reenters with her drink. 		 (') 	Oh, excellent choice. She grabs it and sticks it in the player. The music is dreamy and haunting and slow. Clementine falls back onto the couch, closes her eyes and sips her drink. 		 (') 	Mmmmmmm. Way to go, Joel. You pick 	good. Joel sits down in his chair and drinks. There's a silence, which seems fine to Clementine but makes Joel anxious. 		 	Well, should probably get going. 		 	No, stay. Just for a little while. 		(opens her eyes, brightly) 	Refill? 		 	No. -- 		 	 know a man who needs a refill. She grabs Joel's drink from his hand, takes it into the kitchen. 		 (') (..) (') 	God bless alcohol, is what say. Where 	would be without it. Oh, Jesus, Mary, 	and Joseph, maybe don't want to think 	about that. She giggles. Joel looks around the room again. There are several potatoes dressed as women in beautiful handmade costumes: a nurse potato, a stripper potato, a schoolteacher potato, a housewife potato. Clementine returns with Joel's drink and a refill for herself. 		 	Thanks. 		 	Drink up, young man. It'll make the 	whole seduction part less repugnant. Joel looks a little alarmed. 		 (') 	'm just kidding. 'mon. She sits back on the couch, closes her eyes. Joel watches her, looks at her breasts. She opens her eyes, smiles drunkenly at him. 		 (') 	'know, 'm sort of psychic. 		 	Yeah? 		 	Well, go to a psychic and she's always 	telling me 'm psychic. She should know. 	Do you believe in that stuff? 		 	 don't know. 		 	Me neither. But sometimes have 	premonitions, so, don't know. Maybe 	that's just coincidence. Right? 'know, 	you think something and then it happens, 	or you think a word and then someone says 	it? 'know? 		 	Yeah, don't know. It's hard to know. 		 	Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my 	feeling about it. It's hard to know. 	Like, okay, but how many times do think 	something and it doesn't happen? That's 	what you're saying, right? You forget 	about those times. Right? 		 	Yeah, guess. 		 		(dreamy beat) 	But think am. like to think am. 		 (') 	It's helpful to think there's some order 	to things. You're kind of closed 	mouthed, aren't you? 		 	Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. 	 go to work. go home. don't know 	what to say. 		 	Oh. 		(considers this) 	Does that make you sad? Or anxious? 'm 	always anxious thinking 'm not living my 	life to the fullest, y'know? Taking 	advantage of every possibility? Just 	making sure that 'm not wasting one 	second of the little time have. 		 	 think about that. She looks at him really hard for a long moment. Joel tries to hold her gaze, but can't. He looks down at his drink. Clementine starts to cry again. 		 	You're really nice. 'm sorry yelled 	at you before about it. God, 'm an 	idiot. 		 	 do have a tendency to use that word too 	much. 		 	 like you. That's the thing about my 	psychic thing. think that's my 	greatest psychic power, that get a 	sense about people. My problem is 	never trust it. But get it.

My 	goal... can tell you my goal? 		 	Yeah. 		 		(ala Paul Simon) 	What's the goal, Joel? 		(laughs) 	My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow 	through me? Do you know what mean? 	It's like, there's all these emotions and 	ideas and they come quick and they change 	and they leave and they come back in a 	different form and think we're all 	taught we should be consistent. 'know? 	You love someone -- that's it. Forever. 	You choose to do something with your life 	-- that's it, that's what you do. It's a 	sign of maturity to stick with that and 	see things through. And my feeling is 	that's how you die, because you stop 	listening to what is true, and what is 	true is constantly changing. You know? 		 	Yeah. think so. It's hard to -- 		 	Like wanted to talk to you. didn't 	need any more reason to do it. Who knows 	what bigger cosmic reason might exist? 		 	Yeah. 		 	You're very nice. God, have to stop 	saying that. You're nervous around me, 	huh? 		 	No. 		 	'm nervous. You don't need to be 	nervous around me, though. like you. 	Do you think 'm repulsively fat? 		 	No, not at all. 		 	 don't either. used to. But 'm 	through with that. 'know, if don't 	love my body, then 'm just lost. You 	know? 		 (') 	With all the wrinkles and scars and the 	general falling apart that's coming 	'round the bend. 		(beat) 	So, 've been seeing this guy... Joel looks slightly crestfallen. 		 (') 		(off his reaction) 	Well, for the last week, anyway! He's 	kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but 	he's really stuck on me, which is 	flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And 	he's, like, a dope, but he says these 	smart and moving things sometimes, out of 	nowhere, that just break my heart. He's 	the one who gave me that crow photograph. 		 	Oh, yeah. 		 	That made me cry. But, anyway, we went 	up to Boston, because had this urge to 	lie on my back on the Charles River. It 	gets frozen this time of year. 		 	That's scary sounding. 		 	Exactly! used to do it in college and 	 had this urge to go do it again, so 	got Patrick and we drove all night to get 	there and he was sweet and said nice 	things to me, but was really 	disappointment to be there with him. 	'know? And that's where psychic stuff 	comes in. Like, it just isn't right with 	him. 'know? 		 	 think so. 		 	 don't believe in that soulmate crap 	anymore, but... he says so many great 	things. We like the same writers. This 	writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. 	And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, 	you should come up to the Charles with me 	sometime. 		 	Okay. 		 	Yeah? Oh, great! She sits closer to him. 		 (') 	'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- 	night picnics are different -- and -- 		 		(shy) 	Sounds good. But right now should go. 		 		(pause) 	You should stay. 		 	 have to get up early in the morning 	tomorrow, so... 		 		(beat) 	Okay. Joel puts on his overcoat. Clementine heads to the phone table, pulls out a notepad. 		 (') 	 would like you to call me. Would you 	do that? would like that. 		 	Yes. She scribbles her phone number, hands it to him. He puts it in his pocket. He stands there uncomfortably for a moment, then forces himself to speak. 		 (') 	 don't think your personality comes out 	of a tube. think the hair is just... a 	pretty topping. She tears up, swallows, and kisses him on the cheek. He's surprised and pleased and nervous. 		 (') 		(shyly formal) 	So, enjoyed meeting you. 		 	You'll call me, right? 		 	Yeah. 		 	When? 		 	Tomorrow? 		 	Tonight. Just to test out the phone 	lines and all. 		 	Okay. We stay with Clementine as she watches Joel tromping through the snow and getting in his car. . ' - Joel speeds through the suburban Rockville Center neighborhood. There is no snow on the ground. He seems different, somehow foggy and disoriented. : He arrives at his apartment building and parks. . ' - Joel gets out of his car, spots a van parked across the street. There are two dark figures inside. 		- 	Them. He hurries inside the building. . ' - Joel enters, dumps his overcoat on a chair, turns off the lights, crosses to look furtively out the window. It's snowing in large flakes which seem to fall only in the beam of a streetlight. 		 	It was snowing. 		- 	There are two of them. Couldn't make 	them out. The orange glow of a 	cigarette. Joel squints to see inside the van. Two dark figures talk. One sucks on a cigarette and s dim orange light momentarily illuminates the interior. The figure in the driver seat rolls down his window and gives a cheery wave to Joel. 		 	The driver waved. So casual, friendly. 		- 	'm like a joke to them. Joel pulls away from the window, his face blanched. 		- 	 guess they figure they can act like 	they want. They don't have to worry 	about me remembering. He paces, mulling things over. As he does, the scene starts to change, almost as if it is drying out. 		 	 might be making a mistake. 		- 	Maybe 'm making a mistake. Maybe just 	need to learn to live with this. First 	of all, 'll get over it. Secondly, it 	happened. Those who do not remember 	history are condemned to repeat it. Who 	said that? Churchill? 'm not sure. 	But don't care. She did it to me. 	have to rid myself of this. Fuck her. 		 	Fuck you, Clementine. The colors bleach, the surroundings become slightly vague. Even Joel's persona and voice-over seem to alter, his emotional intensity becoming diffused. Joel does not seem aware of this. He stops pacing, takes a small vial from his pocket, dumps the lone pill onto his palm. He looks at it. It's pink. There's some illegible initials stamped on it. 		 (') 	Pink. 		(beat) 	There was a number on it. remember. 	 1718? 		(beat) 	 have to follow through with this. 	have no choice. 		- 	The pill was pink, remember. It had 	some letters and numbers on it. What 	were they? 1718? something. Four 	digits. don't like taking pills when 	don't know what they are. have no 	choice. He swallows it, peeks out the window again, takes off his clothes, slips into a pair of pajamas fresh from the store packaging. He sits on the edge of the bed, dials the phone. 		 (') 	We're sorry, the number you have 	dialed... 		(beat) 	Screw you, Clementine, for doing this ... 		 	We're sorry, the number you have dialed 	is no longer in service. If you think 	you have reached this recording in error 	- 		 (') 	Bye. Joel hangs up and lies on his back on the bed. By now the scene is lifeless, almost a husk. He hears the apartment building door open. He hears footsteps. 		 (') 	It's them. 		- 	It's too late. His eyelids are getting heavy. He closes his eyes. . He hears a key in his apartment door. 		 (') 	Fuck. . - Joel sits in the bookstore coffee shop. It's a jarring transition, visually and emotionally. Joel is in the midst of some traumatic state of mind. He fingers the vial with the pink pill in it as he watches Clementine stack books on shelves. Her hair is bright orange now. 		 	 should maybe talk to you. 		- 	Clementine. should just maybe talk to 	her. Joel rises and heads toward Clementine. 		 	 love you and if you knew that... if 	told you what happened... 'll explain 	everything, what we meant to each other. 	'll tell you everything about our time 	together. You'll know everything again 	and... 		- 	Maybe if just explain what happened, 	wouldn't have to go through this and 	could tell you everything and it would be 	like you knew and we could rebuild and we 	could be happy again and... Right before Joel gets there, Patrick, a skinny young man approaches Clementine. Joel stops, watches. The young man seems out of breath. He glances over at Joel, then taps Clementine on the shoulder. She turns, annoyed, sees who it is and her face lights up. 		 	Clementine. 		- 	That's your look for me. Clementine giggles, stands and pokes Patrick playfully in the ribs. 		 	 just thought 'd say hi. was in the 	neighborhood. 		 	You were not. 		 	 was not. Joel is mesmerized by their familiarity. As he stands there, the scene starts to dry out. Clementine and Patrick continue their flirtation but it's turning lifeless, as if they are just reciting lines. The bookstore start to lose its color and immediacy. 		 	Come over after 'm done here? 		 	 can't. want to, but have to study. 		 	You rat. 		 	 really want to, but tonight's 	important. Test tomorrow. 		 	How could she have done this to me? How 	could anyone do this to anyone? 		 		(to Patrick) 	You didn't say anything about my hair. 		 	It's so cool. You're by far the most 	sensational person in the room. 		 	In the room? 		 	In the world. Joel seems dazed, in some sort of dream confusion, as he realizes the world around him is looking increasingly odd. 		 	What's happening here? 		(looks at watch; it's 9:30) 	Oh, God! have to go home. They'll be 	there soon. Joel turns to leave. . ' - Joel drives fast, recklessly. The intensity is back. He's weeping as he drives. 		 	Gotta get home. How could she do this to 	me? 	How could she not care about what we 	meant to each other. What a fuck! What 	a fucking monster she is! 		- 	Oh, God. miss her. can't believe 	she's with that guy now! 'm never going 	to see her again. love her so much. 	What a fucking monster she is! The scene is faded as he parks in front of his apartment building, and gets out of the car. Joel spots the parked van. We've seen this before, but it's dried out now. 		 	Them. . - Joel trudges along carrying two big trash bags full of stuff. He's been crying. He looks behind him and finds himself looking out the window of his apartment at the dark van on the snowy street. He turns back to the New York Street and spots the address he was looking for: 610 11th Avenue. . - Joel sits in the small room with his bags. woman across from him cradles a box full of belongings in her lap. Her eyes are red from crying. Mary, the receptionist, pokes her head through her window into the waiting room. 		 	Hello again, Mr. Barish. Good, you've 	got your stuff. . - Joel walks with his bags behind Mary. 		 		(not looking back) 	How are you today? 		(at lab) 	Here we are. . - Joel enters. Mierzwiak stands there with Stan in his lab coat. 		 	Ah, Mr. Barish. This is Stan. He'll be 	in charge of your procedure tonight. Stan nods professionally. 		 	Mr. Barish. 		 	How exactly is this going to work 	tonight? As Mierzwiak talks, the room colors start to fade, Mierzwiak's tone of voice is also affected; it becomes dry and monotonous. 		 	We'll start with your most recent 	memories and go backwards -- There is an 	emotional core to each of our memories -- 	As we eradicate this core, it starts its 	degradation process -- By the time you 	wake up in the morning, all memories 	we've targeted will have withered and 	disappeared. Like a dream upon waking. 		 	Is there any sort of risk of brain 	damage? 		 	Well, technically, the procedure itself 	is brain damage, but on a par with a 	night of heavy drinking. Nothing you'll 	miss. Joel looks quizzically at the eroding environment. Suddenly he gets it. 		 	It's happening now! 'm already in my 	brain. Mierzwiak looks at the fading room. 		 	Yes, suppose you are. 		(back in his faded memory 		 persona) 	So, let's get started -- If we want the 	procedure underway tonight, we have some 	work to do. Joel is sitting in a chair. Electrodes connect him to some electronic machinery monitored by Stan. Mierzwiak watches from the corner. 		 	We use the articles you brought to create 	a map of Clementine in your brain. 	Tonight while you sleep we'll be able to 	trace the map and erase. 		 	But you're tracing and erasing now. It's 	already started. 'm home in my bed. Stan pulls a snow globe from one of Joel's bags, shows it to Joel. The equipment registers Joel's reaction. 		 	Very good. Stan pulls out a potato dressed as a Vegas showgirl. Joel studies it. The machines register his response. 		 	We'll dispose of these mementos when 	we're done here. That way you won't be 	confused later by their unexplainable 	presence in your home. Stan pulls out a coffee mug with a photo of Clementine printed on it. Joel looks at the cup. The machines record his reaction. 		 	Good. We're getting healthy read-outs. The room, Stan, and Mierzwiak are now vague and wispy. 		' 	Patrick, do me a favor -- Joel is watching Stan. Stan is not speaking, yet his voice continues. 		' (') 	-- and check the voltage levels, 'm not 	wiping as clean as would like here. Joel looks up. Stan's voice seems to be coming from above. . ' - Joel lies on his back in fresh pajamas. His eyes are closed and electrodes connect his head to several machines. The machines are operated by Stan, now in grubby street clothes and in need of a shave, and by Patrick, dressed similarly. The monitor on one of the machines traces a myriad of light blips running like streams through an image of Joel's brain. Stan presses buttons and operates a joystick, aiming for the lines. Patrick (who we saw earlier with Clementine at the bookstore) studies a meter on one of the machines. 		 	The voltage looks fine. 		 	Then check the connections. Patrick fiddles with some jacks. 		 	Does that help? 		 	Yeah, that looks better. Thanks. . - The memory is becoming vague, characters' affects flat. Stan pulls out a pile of loose-leaf pages. Mierzwiak smiles. 		 	Ah, your journal. This will be 	invaluable. 		 		(reading) 	December 15th, 2004. met someone 	tonight. Oh, Christ: don't know what 	to do. Her name is Clementine and she's 	amazing. So alive and spontaneous and 	passionate and sensitive. Things with 	Naomi and have been stagnant for so 	long. The scene is just a shell of itself as Stan rattles on. 		' 	 think we got this one. Let's push on. Joel looks up at the ceiling. . ' - Joel, snapped into a new memory, cries as he fills two large plastic garbage bags with mementos of his relationship with Clementine. There are funny little gifts, wind-up toys, some potatoes dressed as women, some clothing Clementine has left there, some 's. He pulls a big clump of pages out of his loose-leaf journal and dumps them in the bag. He gets some clean loose-leaf paper and writes: December 15, 2004 Nothing much happened today. stayed home. Naomi worked on her dissertation. The scene is fading as he continues to write. . - Joel looks for an office number. He finds it. The plaque on the door reads Lacuna Ltd. Joel enters. . - Joel enters the Lacuna waiting room. Mary sits in the reception area. 		 	May help you? 		 	My name is Joel Barish. have an 	appointment. 		 	Please have a seat. Dr. Mierzwiak will 	be right with you. . - Mary leads Joel down the hall. 		 		(without turning) 	How are you today? 		 	Not great. 		 		(at Mierzwiak's office) 	Here we are. Joel glimpses Mary smiling coquettishly at Mierzwiak. . ' - Joel and Mierzwiak are in the sitting area. Joel looks at the tape recorder. 		 	'm sorry you saw one of our notification 	cards. You never should have. 		 	Well... did. 		 	We can help you through this. Why don't 	you start now by telling me everything 	you can remember about your relationship 	with Clementine. 		 		(thinks, then:) 	It was a mess. don't know how it got 	this way... 		' 	It's kind of a dump, don't you think? Joel looks up, trying to locate the voice. . ' - Patrick is checking out the apartment. Stan monitors the equipment. 		 		(uninterested) 	It's an apartment. 		 	Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. 	Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. 	Sort of stuffy. don't know. Stuffy. 		 	Patrick, let's just get through this. We 	have a long night ahead of us. 		 	Yeah. Patrick returns to the bedside, focuses on the machines for a moment. He glances at the unconscious Joel. 		 (') 	So who do you think is better-looking, me 	or this guy? Stan glances sideways at Patrick. . ' - Mierzwiak sits with Joel in the sitting area. 		 	So we'll need you to go home and bring in 	everything you ever received from 	Clementine and anything that might remind 	you of her... The scene is faded and disappearing fast. It's gone. . ' - Joel gets off the elevator and approaches the receptionist. 		 	So then she just stops calling. 		- 	 wasn't going to call her. Not after 	the way she was. 		 	Any messages, Carmen? Carmen the receptionist shakes her head. Next day: Joel approaches the receptionist. 		 (') 	Any messages for me, Carmen. 		 	Nothing, Joel. 		- 	It's bullshit. She's punishing me for 	being honest with her. Joel is at his office desk on the phone. 		 	You have no messages. . ' - Joel enters, checks his phone machine: zero messages. . ' - Joel gets off the elevator, approaches Carmen, who is in conversation with someone else. 		 	Sorry, Carmen. Any messages? Carmen shakes her head ""no"", goes back to her conversation. . ' - Joel checks his machine: zero messages. 		- 	That's it. 'm just gonna-- Without a moment's hesitation, he dials the phone. 		- (') 	'm gonna tell her 'm through playing 	games and -- 		 	The number you have dialed has been 	disconnected. Joel's eyes bug. . ' - Joel sits across Rob and Carrie, mid-40's. 		 	Why would she do that? 		 	-- If you think you have reached this 	recording in error, please check your 	number and dial again. 		 	 don't know, honey. It's horrible. 		 	She's punishing me for being honest. 	should just go to her house. 		 	 don't think you should go there, Joel. 		 	Yeah, don't want to seem desperate. 		 	Maybe you need to look at this as a sign 	to move on. Just make a clean break. 		 	 don't know. 'm so... can't believe 	she'd be so goddamn immature! 		 	Joel, look, the thing is -- 		 		(agitated, interrupting) 	Joel, honey... We have to feed the dog. 	Would you just wait here? Just a second. Joel nods, confused, as Rob and Carrie leave the room and close the door behind them. Joel hears a hushed argument ensue in the hall. He notices the dog asleep on the floor. He grabs a magazine off the coffee table, flips through it distractedly as he paces, puts it down, picks up another. subscription card falls to the floor. He picks it up and is about to shove it back in the magazine when he sees it is not a subscription card at all. It reads: Clementine Kruczynski has had Joel Barish erased from her memory. Please never mention their relationship to her 		 again. Thank you. 		 Lacuna Ltd. 		 610 11th Avenue, , Joel stares at the card, incredulous. Later: Rob and Carrie are now back in the room. 		 (') 	You weren't supposed to see that. 		 	They can't erase memories. It's a joke. 	It's a nasty Clementine hoax. 		 	Sweetie, we called the company. Joel just stands there. Close-up of a vague dictionary page. 		- 	Lacuna: Noun. blank, a missing 	portion, especially in a manuscript. . ' - Joel is on the phone pacing. 		' 	You can't tell her, Joel. They explained 	that. Like waking a sleepwalker. It 	might have a devastating effect. . ' - Joel drives past vague local landmark. 		' 	Think about it: to be told you lived an 	existence of which you have no 	recollection. 		' 	But what am supposed to do? 		' 	Move on, sweetie. 		' 	How can ? How can move on when know 	'm the only one to carry this love we 	had? How do do that? . - Joel in his parked car next to a fence surrounding a drive-in movie closed for the season. He weeps. The windows fog up until the outside is completely obscured. . - Joel looks for an address. . - Joel gets off on the sixth floor. He searches for a room number. As he turns the corner, he sees that the hallway is faded, vague and mostly erased. He keeps walking, comes to the door marked Lacuna and opens it. Inside he can see vague, erased version of Mary the receptionist. 		 		(dead monotone) 	Hi, May help you? These degraded, faded memories allow Joel to detach himself and hear what's going on in his bedroom. 		' 	So, Mary's coming over tonight. Joel looks up. . ' - Stan works the joystick. Patrick sits on the bed with Joel. 		 	Yeah? 		 	Just wanted to let you know. 		 	 like Mary. like when she comes to 	visit. just don't think she likes me. 		 	She likes you okay. 		 	 wonder if should invite my girlfriend 	over, too. have a girlfriend now. 		 	You can if you want. 		 	Did tell you have a new girlfriend? 		 		(re: memory on monitor) 	This one's history. Moving on... 		 	The thing is ... my situation is a little 	weird. My girlfriend situation. 		 	Patrick, we need to focus. Stan aims the joystick. . ' - Joel distractedly reads a book, checks the clock, goes back to the book. The door opens. He looks up. Clementine is staggering in, drunk. 		 	Yo ho ho! 		 	It's three. 		- 	Shit. The last time saw you. 		 (') 	Anyhoo, sweetie, done a bad thing. 	kinda sorta wrecked your car... 		 	 can't believe you wrecked my car. 		 	You're driving drunk. It's pathetic. 		 	...a little. was a little tipsy. 	Don't call me pathetic. 		 	Well it is pathetic. And fucking 	irresponsible. You could've killed 	somebody. The scene is starting to degrade. The acting becomes anemic. 		 (') 	 don't know, maybe you did kill 	somebody. 		 	Oh Christ didn't kill anybody. It's 	just a fucking dent. You're like some 	old lady or something. 		- 	Right! She called me an old lady here, 	too! And remember, said... 		 (') 	And what are you like? wino? 		 	 wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? 	 wino! 		(laughs) 	Face it, Joel. You're freaked out 	because was out late without you, and 	in your little wormy brain, you're trying 	to figure out, did she fuck someone 	tonight? 		 	No, see, Clem, assume you fucked 	someone tonight. Isn't that how you get 	people to like you? This shuts Clementine up. She is stung and she starts gathering up her belongings, which are strewn about the apartment. Joel is immediately sorry he said this. He follows her around. 		 (') 	'm sorry. Okay. didn't mean that. 	just... was just... pissed, guess. Clementine is out the door. Joel follows. . - Joel looks at his dented car, looks at Clementine clomping off in the distance. . ' - Joel drives to catch up with Clementine. He rolls down his window to talk to her. 		 	Let me drive you home. 		 		(without turning) 	Fuck you, Joel. Faggot. 		 	Look at it out here. It's falling apart. 	'm erasing you. And 'm happy. She keeps clomping. 		 (') 	You did it to me. can't believe you 	did this to me. By morning you'll be 	gone. Ha! He stops the car, gets out. . - It's a street you might see in a dream, more an impression of a quiet street than an actual one, with what little detail there is obscured in darkness. Joel wanders it. In the distance Clementine walks off, but as in an animated loop, she doesn't get any farther away. It's lonely. 		' 	See, remember that girl? The one we did 	last week? The one with the potatoes? Joel looks up, startled. 		' 	Yeah, that's this guy's girlfriend. Was. . ' - Stan watches the screen.

So sweet and funky 	and voluptuous. kind of stole a pair 	of her panties, is what. 		 	Jesus, Patrick! . - On the vague street Joel listens to Patrick and Stan. 		' 	 know. It's not like... mean, they 	were clean and all. 		' 	Look, just don't tell me this stuff. 	don't want to know this shit. 		' 	Yeah, okay. 		' 	We have work to do. There's a click and Joel finds himself in -- . ' - Joel and Clementine sit and eat dinner in front of the . It's hard to make out what they're watching. They sit on opposite ends of the couch. They look bored. The scene quickly degenerates. The room fades. 		' 	Okay, but there's more. Joel listens. 		' (') 	After we did her, went to where she 	worked and asked her out. Joel looks over at the faded Clementine across the couch. She stares straight ahead at the . 		' 	Patrick... do you know how unethical... 		 	That must be the guy saw you with. 		- 	In the bookstore that night. The skinny 	guy. There's a click and Joel finds himself in -- . ' - Joel watches . Clementine walks by in her underwear, looks at the . She slips into a skirt. 		 	How can you watch this crap? 		 	Where are you going? 		 	'm fucking crawling out of my skin. The scene starts to fade. Clementine puts on her shoes and heads out the door. . - Joel and Clementine walk around unhappily. They barely look at the animals. Clementine watches parents with babies. 		 	Oh shit. remember this. 		(to Clementine) 	Want to go? 		 		(pissy) 	 want to have a baby. 		 	Let's talk about it later. 		 	No. want to have a baby. have to 	have a baby. 		 	 don't think we're ready. 		 	You're not ready. 		 	Clementine, do you really think you could 	take care of a kid? She turns violently toward him, glaring. 		 	What?! 		 		(mumbly) 	 don't want to talk about this here. 		 	Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it! Joel looks around. People are watching. 		 (') 	You can't fucking say something like that 	and say you don't want to talk about it! 		 	Clem, 'm sorry. shouldn't have -- 		 		(screaming now) 	'd make a fucking good mother! love 	children! 'm creative and smart and 'd 	make a fucking good mother! The scene starts to fade. Clementine's rant continues but becomes attenuated and vague. 		 	Oh, thank God. It's going. 		 	It's you! It's you who can't commit to 	anything! You have no idea how lucky you 	are 'm interested in you! don't even 	know why am! should just end it 	right here, Joel. Leave you in the zoo. 	Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang 	out with! She's crying now, but it's almost animatronic, no real emotion in it. The scene is a husk. 		 	It's going, Clementine. All the crap and 	hurt and disappointment. It's all being 	wiped away. She looks up at him. 		 	'm glad. Their eyes lock. She is fading before his eyes. 		 	Me, too. . - It's noisy and crowded. Joel and Clementine sit at a small table. She is drunk and staring off, blankly. 		 	So, um -- 		 		(swiveling head toward him) 	Would you get me another, Joely? Joel sighs, stands, and heads to the crowded bar. 		 (') 	Thanky! Thanky! Joel is at the bar, trying to get the bartender's attention. Joel is paying the bartender. He turns with the drink to head back to the table. He sees Clementine flirting with a man in Joel's seat. Joel is at the table. Clementine looks from her conversation. 		 (') 	Joel, this is Mark. He likes my boobs. 	He came over special to tell me that. 	Isn't that nice. He doesn't think 'm 	fat. The scene starts to fade. Mark rises. 		 	 didn't know she was with someone, man. 		 	'okay, Mark. Joel doesn't like my 	boobs. 		(stage whisper) 	 don't think he likes girls. The bar gets quiet and vague. 		 	You're drunk. 		 	You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so -- Clementine keeps talking but there are no more intelligible words, just a whisper -- like a breeze. doorbell buzzes. Joel looks up. . ' - Patrick opens the door. Mary stands there in a winter coat, carrying a backpack. 		 		(coolly) 	Oh, hey, Patrick. 		 	Hi, Mary. How's it going? She walks past him. 		 	Hey, you. Stan and Mary kiss. She looks down at Joel as she takes off her coat. 		 	It's freezing out. 		 	You found us okay? 		 	Yeah. 		(re: Joel) 	Poor guy. 		(looking around) 	Have anything to drink? 		 	We haven't checked. 		 	Well, allow me to do the honors. It's 	fucking freezing and need something. She heads into the kitchen. Stan turns back to monitor the slivers of light. 		 	Mary hates me. 've never been popular 	with the ladies. 		 	Maybe if you stopped stealing their 	panties. 		 		(guilty beat) 	Okay, There's more, Stan -- Stan looks over at Patrick. Mary returns with a bottle of scotch and two glasses. 		 	Hey, hey. She pours the whiskey. 		 (') 	Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did 	you? 		 	Nah, don't know. Mary hands a glass to Stan.

Found 	it my Bartletts. 		 	That's a good one. 		 	Yeah, can't wait to tell Howard! It 	seems really appropriate. 		 		(a little sulky) 	It's a good one all right. 		 	What's your bartlett's? 		 	It's a quote book. 		 	 love quotes. So did Winston Churchill. 	He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's 	about Bartlett's. Isn't that trippy? 		 		(trying to engage) 	Yeah. Cool. 		 	""The quotations when engraved upon the 	memory give you good thoughts."" 		 	Very cool. Trippy. 		 	 like to read what smart people say. So 	many beautiful, important things. 		 	Yup. 		 	Don't you think Howard's like that? 	Smart? Important? 		 		(beat) 	Yup. 		 	Definitely! 		 	 think he'll be in Bartlett's one day. Stan focuses on the monitor. Mary pours herself another drink. 		 	Definitely. . ' - It's dark. Joel and Clementine are in bed. The memory is already in the midst of being erased. Clementine is talking in a monotonous, robotic manner. 		 	You don't tell me things, Joel. 'm an 	open book. tell you everything. Every 	damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust 	me. 		 	No, it isn't that. 		 	 want to know you. 		 	 just don't have anything very 	interesting about my life. 		 	Joel, you're a liar. The scene is faded completely now and Joel just lies there for a moment, registering Clementine's statement. . - Joel and Clementine eat dinner in silence. Joel looks around at other couples in the restaurant. Some seem happy and engaged. Others seem bored with each other. He turns back to his food. 		 	How's the chicken? 		- 	Is that like us? Are we just bored with 	each other? 		 	Good. He watches her as she downs her wine and pours herself another glass. She holds the wine bottle up to Joel. 		 (') 	More? 		 	No. Thanks. There's a silence. 		 	How's the fish? The scene is fading. 		 	It's good. They continue to eat in silence as the scene dissolves.

Let him go, Stan. can help. 		 		(sighing, to Patrick) 	Go. 		 		(quietly) 	Mary hates me. 		(into phone) 	'll be right over, Tangerine. . ' - Candles are lit. Joel and Clementine are under a blanket on the living room rug listening to music. 		 	Joely... 		 	Yeah, Tangerine? 		 	Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit? 		 	No. 		 	It's my favorite book. Since was a 	kid. It's about these toys. There's 	this part where the skin Horse tells the 	rabbit what it means to be real. 		(crying) 	 can't believe 'm crying already.

Generally by 	the time you are Real, most of your hair 	has been loved off, and your eyes drop 	out and you get loose in the joints and 	very shabby. But these things don't 	matter at all, because once you are Real 	you can't be ugly, except to people who 	don't understand."" She's weeping. Joel is stroking her hair. They kiss and begin to make love under the blanket. It's sweet and gentle and then it starts to fade. 		 		(screaming) 	No! Jesus, No! He looks down and Clementine's tear-streaked face is fading. She continues as if she's still being made love to, even though Joel is completely beside himself. He jumps up naked and yells at the ceiling. 		 (') 	Please! Please! 've changed my mind! 		(looks down at fading 		 Clementine, then at ceiling) 	 don't want this. Wake me up! Stop the 	procedure! Plea -- . ' - Joel is unconscious on the bed, completely still. Mary and Stan watch the monitor and smoke a joint. After a silence: 		 	It's amazing, isn't it? Such a gift 	Howard gave the world. 		 		(a sigh) 	Yeah. 		 	To let people begin again. It's 	beautiful. You look at a baby and it's 	so fresh, so clean, so free. And 	adults... they're like this messy tangle 	of anger and phobias and sadness... 	hopelessness. And Howard just makes it 	go away. 		 	You love him, don't you? Mary seems surprised, taken aback, caught. She is silent for a long moment. 		 	No. 		(beat) 	Besides, Howard's married, Stan. He's a 	very serious and ethical man. 'm not 	going to tempt him to betray all he 	believes in. Stan takes another drag on the joint, passes it to Mary. . - Patrick, bundled up and carrying a full backpack, trudges through the snow. . ' - Clementine watches out the window as Patrick nears. She's crying. He makes his way up her front stairs. She swings open the door and hugs him. 		 	Oh, baby, what's going on? 		 	 don't know. 'm lost. 'm scared. 	feel like 'm disappearing. 'm getting 	old and nothing makes any sense to me. 		 	Oh, Tangerine. 		 	Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes 	any sense. She pushes herself out of the embrace and looks at Patrick. 		 (') 	Come up to Boston with me? 		 	Sure. We'll go next weekend and -- 		 	Now. Now! have to go now. have to 	see the frozen Charles! Now! Tonight! 		 	Um, okay. 'll call my study partner. 		 	Yay! It'll be great! 'll get my shit. She runs into the bedroom. Patrick is at the phone and realizes he doesn't know Joel's number. After a moment's thought, he *69's. The phone rings. 		' 	Hi, it's Joel. Please leave a message 	after the beep. Beep. 		 		(whisper) 	Stan, it's Patrick. Pick up. 		' 	Hey, where are you? 		 	 got into a situation with the old lady. 	Can you handle things tonight alone? 'm 	really sorry, man. . ' - Stan is on the phone. He's really stoned and watches Mary, stoned herself, dancing in a sexy trance to something soft and low on the stereo. 		 	 can handle it. He's pretty much on 	auto-pilot anyway. . ' - 		 	Thanks, Stan. owe you. Patrick hangs up, rifles quickly through his backpack. He pulls out a silver bracelet, puts it in his pocket, then pulls out a journal, flips through it, keeping an eye on the bedroom door. The handwriting is a woman's. He finds what he's looking for. He reads: 		' 	 took Joel to walk on Charles River with 	me last night. It was so beautiful and 	charming. Joel was nervous about 	stepping onto the ice, but he wanted to 	please me so much -- he's so sweet -- 	that he came out after me. We lay down 	right in the center and watched the 	stars. He took my hand and said "" 	could... . - Joel and Clementine lie together holding hands on the frozen river. They look up at the stars. 		 	...die right now, Clem. 'm just... 	happy. 've never felt that before. 'm 	just exactly where want to be. Clementine looks over at him. Her eyes are filled with love and tears. Then they get vague. The scene is being erased. Joel is panicked. 		 (') 	Clem, no! This can't keep happening. 	Please! Oh, fuck! Please! Crazily, Joel runs off, passing through a series of decayed scenes: He and Clementine arguing in a car, having sex on the beach, laughing and holding hands at a movie, eating grilled cheese and tomato soup together in bed, Joel watching her sleep, them drinking at a bar. He arrives at a decayed version of his first meeting with Mierzwiak. 		 	We can help you through this. Why don't 	you start now by telling me everything 	you can remember about -- 		 	You have to stop this! 		 	What? What do you mean? 		 	'm trapped in my head and everything 	love is being erased! Stop it now! 		 	Yes, but... 'm just something you're 	imagining. What can do? 'm in your 	head, too. . ' - Patrick reads the journal. 		' 	... and we made love right on the ice. 	It was absolutely freezing on my ass! It 	was wonderful. Clementine enters, dressed for the cold. Patrick puts the notebook away. 		 	'm so excited. Yay! 		 	'm excited, too. Oh, and wanted to 	give you this. It's a little... thing. Patrick pulls the bracelet from his pocket, hands it to her. 		 (') 	 didn't have a chance to wrap it. 		 	It's gorgeous. 		(slipping it on) 	Just my taste. 've never gone out with 	a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry 	liked. 		(kisses him) 	Thanks. So let's get going. Long drive. .

(snapping out of memory) 	Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem! 		 	Oh? 		 	 hired them to. We're in my brain. But 	 want it to stop, before wake up and 	don't know you anymore. 		 	Wow. Um, well... can't you just force 	yourself awake? 		 	 don't know. He concentrates. Nothing happens. 		 (') 	Aaargh! It's horrible! 'm trapped! He starts to have a fit, banging against trees, stomping his feet, screaming. But even while he's doing this the memory and Clementine are fading around him. . ' - It's raining out. Joel is reading, slouched in a chair. He looks over at Clementine, stretched out on her belly in her underwear. She's reading, too. 		- 	She's so sexy. 		 	 loved you on this day. love this 	memory. The rain. Us just hanging. Clementine looks over at him, smiles. Her brow furrows in thought. 		 	What if you hide me? 		 	What do you mean? 		 		(formulating) 	Well... if they're looking for me in 	memories 'm in, what if you take me to a 	memory 'm not in? 		(proud) 	And we can hide there till morning. Joel ponders this. The scene and Clementine are beginning to dissolve. Joel grabs Clementine's hand. She giggles with glee. He pulls her out of the scene as it degrades. 		 	Where? Where? Where? He drags her through the landscape of already decayed memories and turns off into: . - The kitchen is dated and vague. Joel and Clementine are in an oversized playpen; they're adults but small. Joel wears footsie pajamas with some vague little animals on them. He holds a a red furry huckleberry hound doll. Clementine is still in her panties and bra. An oversized woman in high heels, seen from a low angle, hurries back and forth preparing dinner. 		 	Jesus. What's this? Joel looks around at the kitchen, at his doll, at the woman. 		 	 must be about two. 		(oddly) 	 want my mommy. She's busy. She's not 	looking at me. 		(back to himself, re: doll) 	Look, my Huckleberry Hound doll! told 	you about this! 		(beat) 	 want my mommy! He starts to cry. Clementine tries to comfort him. She hugs him.

Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. 	The memory. think we're hidden. Joel sucks in some snot. His mother scurries back and forth clanging pots. The room is not decaying. Joel smiles. . ' - Stan and Mary lie on the floor, their stoned minds wandering after sex. Stan suddenly perks up. He looks at the monitor. 		 	It's stopped. 		 	What? 		 	Listen, it's not erasing. He makes his way, naked, to the computer screen. 		 (') 	It's not erasing. He's off the screen. 		 	Where? 		 	 don't know. He's not on the map. Stan tries to break through his marijuana haze. He fiddles nervously with the equipment. 		 (') 	 don't know what to do! don't know 	what to do! Crap. Crap... 		 	Well, what should we do? 		 	 don't know! just said that! 		 	Sor-ry 		(beat) 	We have to do something. He can't wake 	up half done. 		 	Shit! He jerks the joystick spastically. Mary, also naked, gets up and looks over his shoulder at the screen. 		 		(definitely) 	We should call Howard. Stan turns and looks at her. He's stoned and trying to understand her motivation. 		 	No way. can handle this. 		 	This guy's only half cooked. There's no 	time to fuck around, Stan. Stan tries to think. He paces. Mary watches him. Finally: 		 		(without making eye contact) 	Okay. He dials the phone, waits. 		 (') 	Hello, Howard? . ' - The room is dark. groggy Mierzwiak is in bed on the phone. His wife lies beside him, eyes open, listening. 		 	Stan? What's going on? 		' 	The guy we're doing? He's disappeared 	from the map. can't find him anywhere. 		 	Okay, what happened right before he 	disappeared? 		' 	 was away from the monitor for a second. 	 had it on automatic. had to go pee. 		 	Well, where was Patrick? 		' 	He went home sick. 		 	Jesus. All right, what's the address. 		' 	1062 Sherman Drive. Apartment 1E, 	Rockville Center. Mierzwiak writes it down on a bedside not pad.

Stop being stoned, Mary! She hurries into the bathroom with her bag. 		 (') (..) (') 	God, look like shit! God! Mary slams the bathroom door. Stan puts his head in his hands. . - Joel and Clementine are in the playpen. Joel's oversized mother reaches down as she hurries by and pats Joel on the head. 		 	How's my baby boy? She's gone. 		 	 really want her to pick me up. It's 	weird how strong that desire is. Clementine holds his hand. He looks over at her. 		 	You know, we're okay. They're not 	finding us. You'll remember me in the 	morning. And you'll come to me and tell 	me about us and we'll start over. 		 	 loved you so much this day. On my bed 	in your panties. remember thought, 	how impossibly lucky am to have you on 	my bed in your panties. She kisses him. 		 	You remember what happened next? 		 	 came over to the bed and you smelled so 	good, like you just woke up, slightly 	sweaty. And climbed on the bed with 	you and you said something like -- 		 	-- another rainy day. Whatever shall we 	do? He laughs. She unbuttons his pajamas. They begin to make love. Joel's mother hurries around the kitchen. Joel stops, looks at Clementine. 		 	There's this guy! 		 	What? 		 	There's this guy. heard him talking in 	my apartment. He's one of the eraser 	guys. And he fell for you when they were 	erasing you, so he introduced himself the 	next day as if he were a stranger and now 	you're dating him. 		 	Really? Is he cute? 		 	He stole a pair of your panties while you 	were being erased! 		 	Gross! You must remember to tell me this 	in the morning. 'm, like, so freaked 	out now. . ' - It's a rust bucket. Clementine drives through the snow. She's crying and holding Patrick's hand. 		 	What's wrong with me? 		 	Nothing is wrong with you. You're the 	most wonderful person 've ever met. She glances gratefully over at him then starts to cry even harder. . ' - Stan works on trying to get the signal back. His hair is combed and he's dressed neatly, looking professional but still stoned. Mary is pacing nervously to and from the window, looking out into the night. She's dressed also, and she's wearing more make-up now. Her hair is pulled up into some sort of style. Suddenly she freezes at the window. 		 	There he is. Oh my God. Oh my God. Do 	 look okay? She doesn't say anything. 		 (') 	'm still stoned. Are you? Crap. She looks in the mirror. 		 (') 		(to Joel) 	Your Visine didn't do shit, fella. The doorbell buzzes. Mary lunges for the door, then calms herself before opening it. Mierzwiak, holding an equipment bag, looks surprised. 		 	Mary. What are you doing here? 		 	She came to help, Howard. 		 	 wanted to learn as much about the 	procedure as possible, Howard. think 	it's important for my job...to help 	comfort the clientele. You know. Mierzwiak looks from Mary to Stan, nods, and enters. Mary closes the door. Mierzwiak crosses to the equipment. 		 	Let's get to the bottom of this. Shall 	we? He sits down in front of the computer and does some fiddling. 		 (') 	Odd. He fiddles some more. Mary looks on, fascinated. 		 	 tried that already. 		 	Did you try going through -Gate? 		 	Yeah. Of course. Mierzwiak ponders. He unzips his equipment bag, pulls out another laptop computer and plugs it in to the system. 		 	'm going to do a Spectrum search 	throughout his memory, see if anything 	comes up. Mierzwiak presses some more buttons. The program starts up. much more complex and detailed human brain appears on this screen. It rotates. Eventually Mierzwiak sees a small distant light in the brain. He zeroes in on it. 		 (') 	Okay, here it is. don't know why it's 	off the map like that, but -- . - Joel is being bathed in the oversized sink by his oversized mother. Clementine sits in the water with him, laughing. The mother doesn't seem to see her. 		 	Little baby getting awwwl cleean. Awl 	clean. 		 		(to Clementine) 	 love getting bathed in the sink. It's 	such a feeling of security. 		 		(giggling) 	've never seen you happier. The elements of the scene flash explosively away: Joel's mother, his Huckleberry Hound doll, the details of the kitchen, Clementine. Joel is thrown into: . - He sits with Clementine in the parked car, outside a drive-in movie theater. The movie on the giant screen is partially obscured by a fence. Joel and Clementine drink wine. . ' - Mierzwiak looks up from the computer screen. 		 	Okay, we're back in. 		 	That was beautiful to watch, Howard. 	Like a surgeon or a concert pianist. 		 	Well, thank you, Mary. 		 		(sighing) 	You get some sleep, Howard. 'll take it 	from here. 		 	Yeah, probably a good idea. . - Clementine and Joel laugh as they try to give voice to what the characters on the screen are saying. 		 	But can't you see... love you, Antoine. 		 	Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally. 		 	Yes, but can't love a man named Wally. She starts to fade. The scene starts to fade. Joel remembers their previous plan. 		 	They found us before. The plan didn't 	work. don't know what to do now. 		 		(mouthing to woman on screen) 	Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere 	buried? Joel grabs her. They run off just as the scene decays into a husk behind them. . ' - Stan is back at the controls. Mierzwiak's at the door with Mary. 		 	Howard, they've disappeared again. 		 	Oh dear. 		 	'm so sorry, Howard, you must be tired. He nods, distractedly. She smiles to herself as he heads back to the equipment. . - Joel, now the size of a junior high school kid and dressed accordingly, is peering around the corner of the school building toward the bike rack. Clementine is with him, dressed as she was in the parked car. 		 	Look at you, cutey! What are we doing? 		 	This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the 	shit out of me. 		- 	'm terrified. thought if hung 	around the art room long enough, he'd go 	home and could get my bike. They head toward the bike rack. Joel's is the only bike remaining. 		 (') 	Poor Joel. They're at the bike rack and a bunch of kids, including giant, fat Joe Early come around the corner. 		 	Hi, Jill. 		 	He calls me Jill. Everyone calls me Jill 	after this. The other kids laughs. 		 	Just shut up, Joe. 'm going home. 		 	 don't think so. We're fighting. 		 	 don't want to fight you. The kids start chanting, ""fight, fight, fight..."" Joe Early throws a wild punch that hits Joel in the side. joel falls and stays down, covering himself. 		 	'mon, Jill. Get up, faggot. 'mon. Joel doesn't say anything. He peeks humiliated at Clementine. She's watching him. She's got a tear in her eye. She kneels down beside him, puts her arm around him. 		 	'm too scared to even throw a punch. 	When tell people this story leave 	that part out. The scene flashes violently to white and is gone. . ' - Mierzwiak is at the machine. 		 	We got him back. Stan, think 'm just 	going to have to get through this 	manually. We're running late. . - It's cold. Joel and Clementine walk, all bundled up. She points at a house up the beach. 		 	Our house! Our house! She runs ahead, laughing. The scene is decaying. Joel chases after her. 		 	Clem, c'mon, we've got to hide you. 	Remember? He grabs her arm and yanks and they are in: . ' - It's dark. Joel, junior high school size, is in bed masturbating. Clementine is in there, too, in her winter coat, still laughing from before. She realizes what's going on. 		 		(mock offended) 	Joel! 		 		(continuing to masturbate) 	 don't like it either, but 'm just 	trying to find horrible secret place to -- Joel's mother pops her head in the door. 		 	Joel, was just -- 		(sees what's going on) 	Oh. Um... 'll ask you in the morning, 	honey. Have a good night. The mother backs out, closes the door. Joel cringes. Clementine laughs, still in the mode of the memory she was swiped from. Flash! It's all gone. . - Joel and Clementine are laughing as she blows out the candle on a slice of cheesecake in front of her. Joel hands her a small wrapped box. 		 	Happy Birthday. 		 		(unwrapping the gift) 	Thanks, Joely. present! Oh boy! She pulls out the bracelet. It's the same bracelet Patrick gave her. 		 (') 	Oh, Joel. It's beautiful!

She leans across the table to kiss him. He grabs her and runs through the decaying scene and into the vague night. . - Joel is one of a group of five year olds. He holds a hammer and is poised to hit a dead bird in a red wagon. The other boys are goading him. 		 	'mon, Joel, you have to. Do it already. Joel doesn't want to. Clementine watches. 		 	 can't. have to go home. 'll do it 	later. 		- 	 didn't want to do this. But had to 	or they would've called me a girl. Joel miserably smashes the bird repeatedly with the hammer. Red jelly guts cover the hammer and the wagon bottom. The kids hoot. 		- 	 can't believe did that. 'm so 	ashamed. live bird watches from a tree. Clementine, still dressed for her birthday dinner (wearing her new bracelet), pulls Joel away from the other boys. The two of them walk down Joel's suburban street. 		 	It's okay. You were a little kid. 		(beat) 	This is a great birthday present. 	Getting to see you as a boy. She kisses him and they walk holding hands. 		 		(pointing) 	That's where live. Lived. Joel looks down at her hand. It's fading. The bracelet is gone. Clementine is gone. His childhood house is gone. . ' - Mierzwiak works the equipment. He has located a small area of light in the brain imaging and eradicates them. 		 	'm getting the hang of it. still 	understand it. But 'm finding him 	quickly enough. 'm hopeful there won't 	be too much peripheral eradication. Mary sits on the bed. 		 		(a little giggly) 	 like watching you work. Stan sighs, grabs his coat. 		 	'll go out for a smoke. If no one 	minds. 		 		(not looking up) 	That's fine, Stan. Mary doesn't say anything. Stan huffs and is out the door. Mierzwiak continues to find and erase points of light. Mary gets up her courage to speak. 		 	Do you like quotes, Howard? 		 	How do you mean? 		 	Oh, um, like famous quotes. find 	reading them inspirational to me. And in 	my reading 've come across some 	thought you might like, too. 		 	Oh. Well, 'd love to hear some. Mary is thrilled, beside herself. She tries to calm down. 		 	Okay, um, there's one that goes ""Blessed 	are the forgetful, for they get the 	better even of their blunders."" 		 	Is that Nietzsche? 		 	Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here was 	thinking could tell you something you 	didn't know. 		 	It's a good quote, Mary. 'm glad we 	both know it. He smiles at her. She's flustered, flattered. 		 		(sputtering) 	There's another one like, read. It's 	by Pope Alexander. 		 	Alexander Pope? 		 	Yes, shit. Oops, sorry! 		(puts hand over mouth) 	Sorry. It's just told myself wasn't 	going to say Pope Alexander and sound 	like a dope and then go ahead and do 	it. Like psyched myself out. 		 	It's no big deal. 		 	You are such a sweetheart. There's an embarrassed moment as that line hangs in the air. Then Mary plunges ahead to bury it. 		 (') 	Anyway, the quote goes ""How happy is the 	blameless Vestal's lot! The world 	forgetting, by the world forgot: Eternal 	sunshine of the spotless mind! Each 	prayer accepted, and each wish resign'd"". She smiles, proud and embarrassed. 		 	That's lovely. 		 	Really? thought it was appropriate 	maybe. That's all. 		(beat, then quickly) 	 really admire the work that you do. 	know it's not proper to be so familiar 	but guess since we're outside the 	workplace feel a certain liberty to -- 		 	It's fine, Mary. 'm happy to hear it. 		 	Okay. Good. Great. Thanks. 		(blurting) 	 like you, Howard... an awful lot. Is 	that terrible? Mierzwiak seems momentarily taken aback, then returns to his unflappable self. 		 	You're a wonderful girl, Mary. She leans over and kisses him, then pulls away quickly. 		 	've loved you for a very long time. 'm 	sorry! shouldn't have said that. 		 	've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know 	that. 		 		(suddenly weepy) 	 wish was your wife. wish had 	your kids. Mierzwiak comforts her with a hug. It turns into kiss. He pulls away. 		 	We can't do this. 		 	No you're right. Once again. You're a 	decent man, Howard. He smiles sadly at her. She smiles courageously at him. 		 	 want you to know it's not because 'm 	not interested. If that means anything. They look at each other a long while, then Howard goes back to locating and eradicating blips of lights. . ' - Stan sits in the van and smokes a cigarette. He has an unobstructed view into Joel's bedroom window. He watches Mierzwiak and Mary. They're talking as Howard works. It appears to be a very serious discussion. car pulls up outside. Stan turns to see. middle-aged woman gets out, checks the address on Joel's building, approaches the only lit window, watches Mierzwiak and Mary inside. Mierzwiak's resolve has apparently weakened and he and Mary kiss again. This time it leads to groping, partial undressing, and falling onto the bed alongside the unconscious Joel. The woman in the window is transfixed. As Mierzwiak fumbles to unzip his pants, he catches sight of the woman in the window. He practically shrieks and jumps up. . - Joel and Clementine walking, hand-in-hand, look up simultaneously. . ' - Mary looks confusedly at Howard. 		 	What? She follows his eyes and sees the woman in the window, who turns and walks off in a huff. 		 (') 	Oh my God! Mierzwiak is already in his coat. He's out the door. . ' - The woman is at her car. Stan watches from the van. Mierzwiak is hurrying to the woman. 		 	Hollis! Hollis! 		 ( - ) 	 knew it, Howard. don't even know why 	 bothered to copy the damn address. 		 	It didn't start out to be this. came 	here to work. It's a one-time mistake. Mary is right behind Mierzwiak now. Hollis is in her car. 		 		(heroically) 	Mrs. Mierzwiak, it's true. And it's not 	Mr. Mierzwiak's fault. 'm a stupid 	little girl with a stupid little crush. 	 basically forced him into it. swear. Hollis turns, looks at Mary and then at Mierzwiak. 		 	Don't be a monster, Howard. Tell the 	girl. Stan is out of the van now, listening. Mary shivers in the cold, hugs herself. There's a long silence. Then: 		 	Tell me what? Hollis and Mierzwiak have locked eyes. Mary looks back and forth between them. Hollis starts her car. 		 	Poor kid. You can have him. You did. She drives off. Mary watches Howard with increased foreboding. 		 	What, Howard? 		 	We... have a history. 'm sorry. You 	wanted the procedure. You wanted it 	done... to get past. have to finish in 	there. It's almost morning. We'll talk 	later. He shuffles inside. Mary stands there, unable to digest this, struggling in vain to remember. Stan watches. 		 	Let me take you home. Mary shakes her head ""no."" She walks off, dazed. . - Clementine and Patrick lie on their backs on the frozen river and look up at the night sky. 		 	 could die right now, Clem. 'm just 	happy.

She tries to look out the window but can only see her own reflection. . ' - It's deathly silent as Mierzwiak and Stan work on completing the job. Mierzwiak locates a light hidden very deep in the map of Joel's brain. He targets it. . - Joel, the size of a ten year old, sits fishing with his oversized father. Clementine is naked and in the boat, too. She's reading The Play by Stephen Dixon. 		 	 love this book, Joel. Thank you so 	much for telling me about it. Joel is his father. The father is drunk and sullen. He faces away from Joel, looks out at the lake. 		 	Don't be like me, son. Don't waste your 	life. You'll come to a point someday 	where it'll be too late. You'll be sewn 	into your fate... 		 	It was horrifying, seeing my father like 	that. 	There was no hope for me if his life was 	such a failure. And he saw failure in 	me, too, written in my future. Clementine watches the frightened, confused Joel. 		 (') 	Joel, you're not sewn in. He's wrong. 		 	...and there'll be nowhere to go except 	where you're headed, like a train on a 	track. Inevitable, unalterable. The scene poops out of existence with a flash of light. . - Joel finds himself eating Chinese food and sitting across from Clementine. He is ragged and jarred. 		 	'm done, Clem. 'm just going to ride 	it out. Hiding is clearly not working. 		 	Yeah. 		 	 want to enjoy my little time left with 	you. 		 	This is our first ""date"" date. 		 	Do you remember what we talked about? 		 	Naomi, guess. 		 	Yeah. 		 	What was wearing? 		 	God, should know. Your hair was red. 	 remember it matched the wallpaper. 		 	Egad, were you horrified? 		 	No! think you were wearing that black 	dress, y'know, with the buttons. She is wearing the black dress. 		 	No, you were with me when bought that. 	At that place on East 6th. It was later. . - The scene has already been erased. It's just a decayed husk. vague Joel watches a vague Clementine model a black dress. . - Clementine wears a generic black dress now. 		 	Right. Something black though. 		 	'll buy that. Black's always good. 		 	We did talk about Naomi. 		 	 said: Are you sure? You seem unsure. 		 	'm sure, said.

And didn't have an argument. . - Joel and Clementine pull up to Clementine's house. 		 	 dropped you off after. You said -- 		 		(Mae West) 	Come up and see me... now. 		 	It's very late. 		 	Yes, exactly. Exactly my point. . ' - Joel and Clementine are in the midst of awkward shy sex. 		 	This was our first time. The scene starts to fade. Joel watches Clementine disappear. . - Mary enters the dark room, frazzled. She flips on the fluorescent lights and searches the file folders, finds one with her name on it. Her jaw drops. With a shaky hand, she puts the tape into the player on her desk and presses ""play."" 		 	Okay, so just tell me what you remember. 	And we'll take it from there.

It was unfair to you and to me to stay in 	a relationship for that reason. 	thought about Clementine and the spark 	when was with her, but then thought 	what you and had was real and adult and 	therefore significant even if it wasn't 	much fun. But wanted fun. saw 	other people having fun and wanted it. 	Then thought fun is a lie, that no one 	is really having fun; 'm being suckered 	by advertising and movie bullshit... then 	 thought maybe not, maybe not.

The scene is fogging over. 		 	 told her today need to end it. 		 	Is that what you want? 		 	 did it. guess that means something. Clementine shrugs. The scene fades. . - Joel walks with Naomi. 		 	So what's going on, Joel? 		 	 don't know, 've just been thinking, 	maybe we're not happy with each other. 		 	What? 		 	'know, we've been, don't know, sort 	of, unhappy with each other and -- 		 	Don't say ""we"" when you mean ""you."" 		 	 think maybe, we're both so used to 	operating at this level that -- How can 	one person be unhappy?

The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you 	think you have with this chick, once the 	thrill wears off, you're just going to be 	Joel with the same fucking problems. 		 	It's not somebody else. 		- 	 hate myself. Naomi walks off. Joel watches her. The scene fades. . ' - Joel enters, looks around. There's no sign of Clementine. Joel approaches a male employee. 		 	Is there a Clementine who works here? 		 #1 		(calling to another male 		 employee) 	Mark, is Clem on tonight? 		 #2 	On my dick, bro. 		(turns, sese Joel, embarrassed) 	Oh, hey. Yeah, think she's upstairs in 	Philosophy. Joel climbs stairs, searches the aisle, spots Clementine. 		 	Hi.

Hi, Rob and Carrie. 		 	Go back to sleep. The room is starting to decompose. 		 	Yeah. Come to bed. 'm cold. 		 	In a minute. Naomi turns over.

Who was the girl you walked off with? 		 	No one. . - Rob, Carrie, and Joel emerge from the car, parked amidst a small cluster of cars in an otherwise empty parking lot. . - Joel watches his shoes in the sand as he trudges along. 		 	Is this the right way? . - Joel, Rob, and Carrie step out of the brush and see a bonfire down the beach. People and music can be heard. . - Joel sits on a log, a paper plate of chicken and corn on his lap. People warm themselves at the fire. Joel watches couples talking, kissing, Rob sharing a joint with a guy. 		 	You were down by the surf. could just 	make you out in the dark. Joel looks down to the water. There's Clementine, in her orange hooded sweatshirt, looking out to sea. 		 (') 	Your back to me. In that orange 	sweatshirt would come to know so well 	and even hate eventually.

Hi there. 		 	Hi. 		- 	 was so nervous. What were you doing 	there, wondered. Your hair was lime 	green. Green revolution. shot of her green hair. 		 	You said... 		 	 saw you sitting over here.

Yeah. don't ever know what to say. 		 	 can't tell you how happy am to hear 	that. mean, don't mean 'm happy 	you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... 'm 	such a loser. Every time come to a 	party tell myself 'm going to be 	different and it's always exactly the 	same and then hate myself after for 	being such a clod. 		 	Even then didn't believe you entirely. 	 thought how could you be talking to me 	if you couldn't talk to people? 		- 	But thought, don't know, thought it 	was cool that you were sensitive enough 	to know what was feeling and that you 	were attracted to it. 		 	But, don't know, maybe we're the normal 	ones, y'know? mean, what kind of 	people do well at this stuff? 		- 	And just liked you so much. 		 (') 	You did? You liked me? 		 	You know what did. 		 	Yeah, know. 'm fishing. 		 	You said -- She picks a drumstick off of Joel's plate. 		 	'm Clementine. Can borrow a piece of 	your chicken? 		 	And you picked it out of my plate before 	 could answer and it felt so intimate 	like we were already lovers. 		 (') 	 remember -- 		- 	The grease on your chin in the bonfire 	light.

(singing) 	Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my 	darlin', Clementine... ? Huckleberry 	Hound? That sort of thing? 		 	Yeah, like that. 		 	Nope. No jokes.

What do we do? 		 	Enjoy it. Say good-bye. She nods. Joel and Clementine are walking near the surf.

You should try Xanax. mean, it's a 	chemical and all, but it works... and it 	works just having it around, knowing that 	it's there. Like insurance. 		 	yeah? 		 	'll give you a couple.

There's this poem -- 		 	Did this conversation come before or 	after we saw the house? 		 	 think, before. 		 	Seems too coincidental that way. 		 	Yeah, maybe. Joel and Clementine wander near some beach houses closed for the winter. 		 (') 	Do you know her poem that starts ""Seaside 	gusts of wind,/And a house in which we 	don't live... 		 	Yeah, yeah.

Female. 		 	At least haven't been barking up the 	wrong tree. She finds a window that's unlatched. She lifts it. 		 (') 	Cool. 		 	What are you doing? 		 	It's freezing out here.

It's dark. 		 	Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name? 		 	Naomi. She's searching through drawers for something. She pulls out a flashlight, shines it in Joel's face. 		 	Ah-ha!

Did you have fun? Joel nods glumly. Carrie continues to talk, but her voice goes under as Joel studies the faded husks of memories, piled like refuse outside the moving car window. He sees dried-out version of previous interactions with Clementine playing out in loops. He looks back and sees the memory of his ride home from the beach with Rob and Carrie. It, too, is decaying. Soon all has crumbled into dust. Everything goes black. . ' - Howard watches the monitor. The last specks of light are fading. It grows dark. He is tired, his eyes are hollow.

She sticks her tongue in his ear in a way that's trying to be sexual but just feels embarrassing to him. They finish and lie there.

Suddenly, Joel turns and makes his way through the crowd. He climbs the stairs, crosses the overpass and makes his way to the empty platform. An almost empty train pulls into that platform. Joel gets on the train and watches the business commuters through the dirty window as his train pulls out of the station. . ' - Mary gets out of bed. She has been crying all night. She's a wreck.

He lies on his back beside her, their bodies touching. He wants to turn to her, but out of shyness, doesn't. She holds his hand. They look up at the stars. She smiles, doesn't say anything and snuggles closer to him. 		 	Listen, did you want to make love? 		 	Make love? 		 	Have sex. 'know -- 		 	Oh, um...

Flattery will get you everywhere, 		 my boy. But 'm afraid have to 		 trust Floris on this one. You see, 		 she has her doctorate in speech 		 impedimentology from Case Western. 		 Perhaps you've read her memoirs, 		 "" can't understand a word any of 		 you are saying."" 				 		 No. 				 		 Pity, it tells it like it is. 		 That's why the eastern, read Jewish, 		 publishing establishment won't touch 		 it. That's a quote from the book 		 jacket. George Will, think.

There 	are a few people scattered about the squat theater. Craig 	is among them. He looks around the room and his eyes rest 	momentarily on Maxine. She is in her late 20's with close 	cropped black hair. Her eyes are opaque, her face 	expressionless, her countenance trance-like. She glances 	over at Craig, then turns back to the screen.

Welcome to the 7 1/2 floor of the 		 Mertin-Flemmer building.

Both hold cups of coffee. 				 		 Hello, Don. 				 		 Hello. Wendy. 				 		 Don, was wondering, do you know 		 why our workplace has such low 		 ceilings? 				 		 It's an interesting story, Wendy. 		 Many years ago in the late 1800's, 		 James Mertin, an Irish ship captain 		 looking to invest in the future of 		 our great country, came to this town 		 and decided to erect an office 		 building. 									 : 	 . 				 (') (.0.)

He appears very stern and has mutton chop 	sideburns. 				 (') (.0.) 		 One day. Captain Mertin received an 		 unexpected visitor. 	There is a knock at the door. 				 		 Enter ye, if ye dare enter. 	 tiny woman enters. 				 		 Captain Mertin? 				 		 What want ye, girl child? 				 		 am not a child, Captain Mertin, 		 but rather an adult lady of miniature 		 proportions. 				 			 (taken aback) 		 see. Well, it is not my fault that 		 thou art tiny. So if it is charity 		 yer after, then be gone with ye, 		 ye foul demon. 				 		 am not asking for alms, but rather 		 the ear of a kind man with a noble 		 heart. 				 			 (sighs) 		 Aye. Speak then if ye must. 				 		 Captain Mertin, surely am a 		 God-fearing Christian woman like 		 yourself, but alas, am afraid that 		 the world was not built with me in 		 mind. Door knobs are too high, chairs 		 are unwieldy, high-ceilinged rooms 		 mock my stature. Nor am a marrie 		 lady, Captain. after all, who would 		 marry a person of my diminutiveness? 		 So am forced to work for my few 		 pennies a week as an optometrist. 		 Why cannot there be a place for me 		 to work safe and comfortable? 	Mertin wipes a tear from his eye. 				 		 Woman, your story moves me like n 		 other. Me own sister was tiny and 		 then died. Therefore, shall make 		 ye me wife. And shall build a 		 floor in my building, between the 		 7th and 8th, which will be scaled 		 down, so from now on there shall 		 be at least one place on God's green 		 Earth that you and your accursed 		 kind can live in peace... 									 : 	. 7 1/2 - 	Don And Wendy crouch and talk. 				 		 So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since 		 the rents are considerably lower 		 this floor has been adopted by 		 businesses which for one reason 		 or another are forced to cut corners 		 After all... the overhead is low! 		 Ha ha ha! 				 		 Ha ha ha! 	:	The End 									 : 	. - 	The screen goes dark. The lights go up. Craig looks over 	at Maxine. She stands and walks past him. 				 		 Moving story. 				 		 Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. 		 The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil 		 that it could never be revealed 		 to Americans raised on sitcoms and 		 happy news anchors. 				 		 Is that true? 				 		 Well, truth is for suckers, isn't 		 it?. 				 		 Listen. 'm Craig Schwartz, just 		 starting out at LesterCorp.

The neighbor pounds on the wall. 									 : 	. ' - 	The dining room table is set up. Craig and Lotte and their 	friends Peter and Gloria are seated and eating dinner.

What're you up to in 		 this vacant office. 				 		 Well, Don, peeked in here, even 		 though know it's against floor 		 policy. and discovered that 		 there's a little tiny door in here. 		 Isn't it cute? It's almost like a 		 little dolly's door. wonder what 		 it’s for. 				 			 (laughing) 		 That's right, Wendy, it is against 		 floor policy, but as long as you're 		 here, let me tell you what know 		 about our cute little door friend. 		 Many years ago, this very office 		 was occupied by a kindly old 		 watchmaker named Mr. White. 									 : 	. ' - 	An old man toils away in the dusty office. 				 		 Hmmm. must have a small store 		 room to store my merchandise when 		 am through working on it. know, 		 will build a tiny store room. 		 How cute! 									 : 	. - 				 		 Wow! That's some story, Don. 				 		 Truth is stranger than fiction, 		 Wendy! 	They laugh. 	:	 									 : 	. - 	The lights go up. Craig sits there for a moment. An usher 	pushes a broom down the aisle. 				 		 Bullshit. 	Craig exits. The usher mumbles something into a 	walkie-talkie. 									 : 	. - 	Craig opens the little door and climbs into the 	membranous hallway. The door slams shut behind him. 									 : 	. - 	It's dark and wet. The walls are soft and membranous. 	There is a dripping sound. Craig crawls along. Soon 	something starts to pull Craig as if he is being sucked 	through a straw. There is a flash of light. 									 : 	. - 	The of someone reading a newspaper. The person lifts 	a cup of coffee to his mouth. There is a slurping sound. 	The person puts down the coffee cup and the newspaper, and 	stands up. 				 (') (.0.) 			 (losing his balance) 		 Whoa! What the hell? Where am ? 	We're still in . The person walks across the room, picks 	up his wallet from a coffee table. looks in a mirror and 	checks his teeth for food. It's John Malkovich. 				 (') (.0.) 		 Holy shit! It's that actor guy. 		 Shit! What's his name? That actor 		 guy! What's happening? Am 		 inside him? Am in his brain? 		 Am him? Is he me? Does he know 		 'm here? My brain is reeling! 		 Is his brain reeling? 	Malkovich walks to the front door, opens it, exits his 	apartment. 									 : 	. ' - 	Maxine sits at her desk, eats a sandwich. looks at a 	fashion magazine, and chats on the phone. 				 		 The puppeteer told me he loves me 		 today.

(resonant throughout) 		 The Broadhurst Theater, please. 	The cabbie studies Malkovich in his rearview mirror as he 	drives. 				 		 Say, aren't you that actor guy? 				 		 Yeah. 				 		 John Makel... 				 (.0.) 		 John Malkovich! Of course! 				 		 Mapplethorpe? 				 (.0.) 		 Malkovich. 				 		 Malkovich! 				 (.0.) 		 John fucking Malkovich!

Yeah, okay. 	The cabbie hands a pad back over the seat. Malkovich 	reaches for it. There is a slurping sound. 				 (.0.) 			 (panicky) 		 Ahhhh! 	The image starts to fade, then suddenly goes black. 									 : 	. - 	It’s on the side of Jersey Turnpike. There is a “pop” and 	Craig falls from nowhere into the ditch. He is soaking wet, 	and now dirty from the ditch. He stands, looks confusedly 	around, sees a .. Turnpike sign. After a moment, he goes 	to the side of the road and sticks out his thumb. 									 : 	. ' - 	Maxine sits behind her desk with her feet up, and talks on 	the phone. 				 		 Absolutely, doll. 'm just about 		 to close up here. 	Craig walks in disheveled and exhausted. Maxine sees him, 	keeps talking. 				 (’) 			 (into phone) 		 Meet you at “The Pig” in twenty 		 minutes. 			 (laughs lasciviously) 		 Oh yeah, maybe 'll keep my legs 		 closed till then. 			 (hangs up. to Craig) 		 'm splitting for the day. Lock up 		 for me, won't you, darling. 	Maxine stands, puts some stuff in her purse. 				 		 Don't you want to know what happened 		 to me? 				 			 (considers) 		 No. 	Maxine heads for the door. Craig grabs her arm. 				 		 This is important! 				 			 (looking at his hand on her arm) 		 It better be. 	Craig sits Maxine down in a chair, lets go of her arm. 				 		 There's a tiny door in that empty 		 office. It's a portal, Maxine. It 		 takes you inside John Malkovich. 		 You see the world through John 		 Malkovich's eyes, then, after about 		 fifteen minutes, you're spit out into 		 a ditch on the side of The New Jersey 		 Turnpike. 				 		 Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is 		 John Malkovich? 				 		 He's an actor. One of the great 		 American actors of the 20th century. 				 		 What's he been in? 				 		 Lots of things. He's very well 		 respected. That jewel thief movie, 		 for example. The point is that this 		 is a very odd thing, supernatural, 		 for lack of a better word. It raises 		 all sorts of philosophical questions 		 about the nature of self, about the 		 existence of the soul. Am me? Is 		 Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha 		 right, is duality an illusion? Do 		 you see what a can of worms this 		 portal is? don't think can go 		 on living my life as have lived 		 it. There's only one thing to do. 		 Let's get married right away. 				 		 Is this Malkovich fellow appealing? 				 		 Yes, of course. He's a celebrity. 				 		 Good. We'll sell tickets. 				 		 Tickets to Malkovich? 				 		 Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop. 				 		 But there's something profound here, 		 Maxine, we can't exploit it. 				 		 Fine. 'll do it myself. was going 		 to offer a partnership to you, but 		 this way it's more money for me. 				 		 You wanted to be partners with me? 				 			 (bored) 		 Sure. It'd be fun. 				 			 (pleased) 		 Really? 			 (then:) 		 But, Maxine, can of worms! End of 		 the world! Illusory nature of 		 existence! 				 		 'll protect you, Dollface. 	Maxine reaches over and squeezes his lips affectionately 	between her thumb and forefinger. 				 			 (in love) 		 Oh. Maxine. 									 : 	. ' - 	Craig and Lotte are getting into evening clothes. 				 		 Don't be ridiculous. There is no such 		 thing as a portal into someone else's 		 brain.

Now? 				 		 Yeah. We'll do it right now. On 		 the way to Lester's house. 									 : 	. ' - 	Craig holds open the small door as Lotte climbs in. 				 		 'll meet you on the turnpike. 				 		 'm scared. 	The door slams shut. 				 		 Me too, babe. 	Craig hurries out the door. 									 : 	. - 	Malkovich is in the shower. We watch from his as 	he soaps himself. He does this in a sensual manner. 				 (.0.) 		 Holy cow! 	Malkovich steps out of the shower, slowly towels himself 	dry. 				 (.0.) 		 Oh, yes. Yes. 									 : 	. - 	Lotte lands in the ditch. She is wet and ragged. Traffic 	whizzes by. Craig turns on the headlights in his parked 	car. They shine on Lotte. Craig steps out of the car. 				 		 have to go back. 				 		 Okay. Maybe tomorrow. 				 		 have to go back now. 				 		 We'll talk about it in the car. 	Craig helps Lotte up and toward the car. 									 : 	. ' - 	Craig drives. Lotte looks distractedly out the window. 				 		 have to go back, Craig. Being 		 inside did something to me. All of a 		 sudden everything made sense. knew 		 who was. 				 		 You weren't you. You were John 		 Malkovich. 				 			 (tickled) 		 was, wasn't ? 			 (yelling out the window) 		 was John fucking Malkovich! 			 (laughs, then intensely) 		 Take me back, Craig. 				 		 Tomorrow. We're late for Lester. 									 : 	. ' - 	It's a posh place with flocked wallpaper and candelabras. 	Lester, Craig, and Lotte sit around an elegantly appointed 	table with all different sorts of juices in front of them. 	Lotte is still wet. Lester sits quite close to her. 				 		 Tell me, Lotte, can you understand 		 a word 'm saying? 				 		 Yes, of course, Dr. Lester. 				 		 Oh, be still my heart. 				 		 Dr. Lester, would you point me 		 toward the restroom? 				 		 With immense pleasure, my dear. Down 		 that hall, ninth door on the left. 		 Watch the step down. It's sunken, 		 you know. 	Lotte smiles, and heads down the hall. 				 		 Dr. Lester... 				 		 More beet-spinach juice, my friend? 				 		 No thank you sir. It's delicious, 		 though. just wanted to thank you 		 for the opportunity to work at 		 LesterCorp, but 'm afraid 'm 		 going to have to tender my resignation 		 effectively immediately. 				 		 see. Are you unhappy at our little 		 company? 				 		 No sir, not at all. It's just that 		 'm going to open my own business 		 and... 				 		 And what sort of business will this 		 be? If you don't mind my asking. 				 		 Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right 		 on 7 1/2 actually. 			 (beat) 		 In the vacant office. So we'll still 		 be seeing each other. 				 		 The vacant office. see. Olive oil. 		 Interesting. Be warned, Schwartz, 		 there are certain “doors” which 		 should never be opened. 									 : 	. ' - 	Lotte walks down the ritzy hallway. She is counting closed 	doors in search of the bathroom. She opens a door, looks 	inside, gasps, then enters the room. 									 : 	. ' - 	Lotte enters the room. It is dark. At the far end there 	is what amounts to a candle-lit shrine to John Malkovich. 	The centerpiece of the shrine is an enormous photograph 	of Malkovich bordered by a garland of flowers. Lotte stares 	at it for a moment, then drops to her knees in front of it. 									 : 	. ' - 	Lotte has just taken a shower. She towels herself dry in 	much the same way as Malkovich. Her eyes are closed. She 	opens them slowly and sees herself in the mirror. 	Disappointedly, she drops the towel and heads out of the 	bathroom. 									 : 	. ' - 	Craig sits at his work table. He is pulling the heads off 	of the Craig and the Maxine puppets. He puts the Maxine 	head on the Craig puppet. He sighs. 				 		 My kingdom for your portal, Maxine. 									 : 	.

Maxine spots Malkovich. and heads over. He focuses on her. 				 		 Hi. 'm so glad you decided to 		 come. 'm Maxine. 	Maxine holds out her hand. She is charming. Malkovich takes 	her hand.

After dinner 'll show you my puppets. 				 		 Ah. 				 		 After that 'll introduce you to my 		 favorite monkey, Elijah. He's got an 		 ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood 		 trauma.

The ones who don't go 		 after what they want... well, who 		 gives a shit about them anyway? 	Maxine laughs. There is another silence. Suddenly, at the 	same moment, both Craig and Lotte lunge for Maxine and 	start kissing her passionately about the face and neck. 	They stop just as suddenly and look at each other. 				 		 You? 	Lotte looks away. 				 		 Craig, just don't find you 		 attractive. And, Lotte, 'm smitten 		 with you, but only when you're in 		 Malkovich.

Erroll sits in a chair in front of Craig's desk. He 	glances nervously over at Maxine. 				 		 When you say, can be somebody 		 else, what do you mean exactly? 				 		 Exactly that.

Erroll takes out his wallet. 									 : 	. - 	Craig waits by his car, checks his watch. ""Pop!"" Erroll 	plops into the ditch, wet and unkempt.

Craig ushers Malkovich to the portal door, opens it. 				 			 (repulsed by the slime) 		 Jesus. 	Malkovich climbs in. The door closes.

It's scary: giant toads, swirling eddies of garish, colored 	lights, naked old people pointing and laughing, black velvet 	clown paintings. 									 : 	. - 	Malkovich pops into a chair in a swakn night club. He's 	wearing a tuxedo. The woman across the table from him is 	also Malkovich, but in a gown. He looks around the 	restaurant. Everyone is Malkovich in different clothes. 	Malkovich is panicked. The girl Malkovich across the 	table looks at him seductively, winks and talks. 				 		 Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich 		 Malkovich... 	Malkovich looks confused.

The waiter jots it down on his pad. 				 		 Malkovich. 	Malkovich pushes himself away from the table and runs for 	the exit. He passes the stage where a girl singer Malkovich 	is singin sensuously into the microphone. She is backed by a 	'40's style big band of Malkoviches.

Malkovich looks up. beer can comes flying out of the car 	and hits him on the head. 									 : 	. ' - 	Craig is feeding the animals. His gun is stuck in his pants. 	He gets to Lotte's cage.

The sound of running feet, huffing frantic breathing. We 	watch from up in a tree (Elijah's ) as two men in safari 	suits chase a couple of chimps across the jungle floor. The 	chimps are screaming as the safari men tackle them and tie 	them up. The safari men laugh. 				 		 Well, there monkeys ain't going 		 nowhere. Let's get us a couple a 		 brews 'fore the boss comes back... 	The safari men leave the chimps on the ground. We descend 	from the trees to the ground next to the bound chimps.

Before the great bald 		 chimp-men return. 	 small pair of chimp hands enter into the frame and 	struggle to untie the ropes, but to no avail. Chimp two 	speaks. 				 ( ) 		 Hurry, Elijah! 				 		 Why you little bastard! 	Elijah is wrestled to the ground amidst much screaming. 									 : 	. ' - 	Elijah shakes off the memory and looks determinedly at the 	ropes on Lotte's hands.

Lotte unlocks 	the cage, and dials the phone. 				 		 Maxine! Listen: It hasn't been me 		 in John the last three times. Craig's 		 had me locked up in the apartment.

Malkovich tenses up, then shakes his head in an awkward, 	puppet-like manner. When Malkovich speaks, it seems to be 	against him will. 				 		 Yes. How did you know it was me? 				 		 Lotte called me. 				 		 Oh, so the bitch escaped. 				 		 Apparently you can control this 		 Malkovich fellow now. 				 		 'm getting better all the time. 				 		 'll say you are.

Malkovich begins undressing, and does a lewd bump and grind 	while looking mortified. Maxine giggles. Malkovich (Craig) 	laughs wildly. 									 : 	. ' - 	Lester's hand is in a bloody bandage.

On stage, Malkovich is now 	performing the ""back of the car scene"" from ""On The 	Waterfront."" He alternates between the Marlon Brando part 	and the Rod Steiger part, moving back and forth from one 	stool to the another. He performs it magnificently. We see 	Lester in the audience wiping a small tear from his eye. 				 		 Not too shabby. 	Mantini is now sitting in a good aisle seat next to a 	beautiful woman. Her boyfriend is being hauled toward the 	exit by the usher. The beautiful woman watches, with some 	concern, as the boyfriend is taken away. Then she turns and 	smiles flirtatiously at Mantini. Mantini smiles back. On 	stage Malkovich is dressed in a ringmaster's outfit and 	juggling chainsaws. 				 		 Nothing more than a Goddamn clown. 	At this point the entire audience stands and gives Malkovich 	a spontaneous standing ovation. All except Mantini. Even the 	cultists get up. 									 : 	. - 	Lotte sits sadly in the wet tunnel. She is scrunched-up 	against the damp cold. small fire smolders in front of 	her. We hear footsteps approaching. It is Elijah, carrying 	supplies: food and blankets. He covers her with a blanket 	and sits down next to her. 				 		 They're going to take over the 		 world, Elijah. Evil will reign. 		 But, then, evil already reigns, 		 doesn't it?

Six guys in brown turtlenecks and 	stylized wire horse heads mill about. The 60 foot Harry . 	Truman puppet is pacing, his strings extending up into the 	flyspace and out of sight. Malkovich sits on a bench. Truman 	and Malkovich both take stabs at British accents. 				 . 		 Do you dream often? 				 		 Do you? 				 . 		 It's my job to ask the questions.

(without turning around) 		 Keep your eyes in your pants, old 		 timer. 									 : 	. - 	It's intermission. The lobby is crowded. Maxine moves 	through the crowd listening to snippets of conversation. 	Flemmer, now in a tuxedo, moves about also.

Second couple: 				 #3 		 What's with the Malkovich puppet? 		 He was much better in Vegas when he 		 played the piano with his feet. 				 #4 		 hate it when they try to stretch.

Maxine enters, flops herself down on the couch and lights 	up a cigarette. 				 		 You'd better turn on the pyrotechnics, 		 lover, 'cause right now you're running 		 neck and neck with the dead president. 		 And you're both in last place. 	Malkovich continues to watch himself in the mirror, nods his 	head. 									 : 	. - 	Mantini leans against a rail and smokes a cigarette.

Flemmer picks up the giant wooden controls 	for the marionette, and pulls a copy of the play from his 	pocket. 									 : 	. - 	We watch the second act in progress. The Truman puppet pace 	as he delivers a monologue. Somehow he doesn't even seem to 	be a puppet anymore, so subtle and graceful are his 	movements and the changes in his facial expressions.

Totally, infallibly, inevitably 		 account for Me? ... Poor Dr. Dysart!' 	Malkovich watches impressed and a little scared by this 	bravura performance. He glances out into the audience and 	sees a silent, rapt crowd. 									 : 	. - 	Malkovich is delivering a monologue. Acting up a storm. 	During Malkovich's speech, Truman repeatedly attempts to 	upstage him, nodding his head, looking thoughtful, raising 	his ten foot eyebrows in surprise... 				 		 Eyes! ...

Malkovich continues with the convulsions, milking 	it. Truman speaks. 				 . 		 Here ... Here ... Sssh ... Sssh ... 		 Calm now ... Lie back. Just lie back! 		 Now breathe in deep. Very deep.

'll take it away! He'll be 		 delivered from madness. What then? 		 He'll feel himself acceptable! What 		 then? 	Malkovich has upPed his convulsions now. He watches Truman 	out of the corner of his eye while writhing tormentedly on 	the bench. He levitates. Spins in mid-air. Falls on all 	fours and does an uncanny impression of a yelping dog. 	Truman watches Malkovich, continues to speak. But now, when 	he talks, fire comes out of his mouth. 				 . (') 		 'll heal the rash on his body.

The audience applauds. Truman continues his speech, 	now transforming himself into an actual 60 foot swan and 	flying around the auditorium as he speaks. 				 . (') 		 You won't gallop anymore, Alan. Horses 		 will be quite safe. You'll save your 		 pennies every week, till you can 		 change that scooter into a car... 	The audience watches the giant swan overhead, necks craned, 	in awe. Malkovich sighs. He is out of his league. He goes 	into a remarkable tap dance routine and sings ""Mr. 	Bojangles"", but nobody even looks at the stage. The giant 	swan bursts into flames, flies back onto the stage, burns 	to a crisp, then rises from his ashes as the actual Harry . 	Truman. Truman looks confused and disoriented, as if just 	raised from the dead. 				 		 Where am ? Aren't dead? 			 (possessed) 		 Vote for Mantini! 	Truman grows and grows until he is again just a giant 	puppet. The audience bursts into applause, then delivers a 	standing ovation. Truman bows. Flemmer laughs wildly in the 	catwalks. Malkovich walks dejectedly from the stage. 									 : 	. - 	Malkovich walks past Maxine. She doesn't even look at him. 	Thunderous applause is heard in the background. 				 		 Good-bye, Maxine. 				 		 Whatever. 	Malkovich drops limply to the floor. He lifts his head. 				 			 (weak but relieved) 		 'm back! My nightmare is over. 									 : 	. - 	Flemmer watches Malkovich from above. He pulls out a 	walkie-talkie. 				 			 (into walkie-talkie) 		 Okay, now! 									 : 	. ' - 	Lester is surrounded by all the Malkovichians. He holds 	the walkie-talkie, has just received word. He nods, and 	the Malkovichians crawl in single file into the portal, 	while shrieking a war cry. 									 : 	. - 	Maxine watches as Malkovich pulls himself up off the ground. 	Suddenly, he is again possessed, first by one person, then 	by two, then by three, his body jerking and pulsating with 	each new occupant. It's almost like popping corn, starting 	out slowly, then going faster and faster, until Malkovich 	is possessed by all fifty Malkovichians. He shrieks a war 	cry and runs out onto the stage. 									 : 	. - 	The Truman puppet now hangs limply from the catwalks. 	Malkovich hovers just above the stage and addresses the 	audience. 				 			 (now sounding like fifty voices) 		 am your earthly king! Kneel before 		 me! 	The audience scoffs at first, but then are compelled to 	their knees. 				 			 (like automatons) 		 Hail Malkovich, king of the damned. 	Malkovich laughs, gives the thumbs up sign to Flemmer in 	the catwalks. Flemmer gives the thumbs up sign back. 	Lotte appears in the back of the theater, an out-of-breath 	figure in shadows. It is too late. She runs from the 	theater. 									 : 	. - 	Maxine watches, somewhat amused. She turns and heads for 	the exit. 									 : 	. - 	 dejected Craig walks along the shoulder. He is wet and 	cold. We hold on him for a long while until he eventually 	merges with the landscape. 	 	 	. - 	: 	Something is wrong. It's a typical midtown street, but 	everything is painted gray: the buildings, the streets, 	the sidewalks, the cars. People walk along the streets, 	carrying gray briefcases, wearing gray jumpsuits. Nobody 	talks, nobody smiles. Gray birds fly silently in the sky. 	There is no noise whatsoever. There are several movie 	theaters on the block. All marquees advertise John Malkovich 	movies. Around the corner comes Malkovich. He is floating 	about ten feet off the ground on an enormous, bright red, 	jeweled throne. He wears a gold crown and purple silk robe 	and smiles condescendingly, majestically. Floris sits on his 	lap. She is dressed in an orange satin gown. Nobody on the 	street looks up. 				 			 (fifty voices) 		 Greetings, my lowly subjects. 				 		 Great things, my lonely subtext? 				 			 (rolls his eyes) 		 Boy, be careful what you wish for. 			 (to Floris) 		 Never mind, dear.

Without pause the entire street of gray clad people breaks 	into a meticulously choreographed production number. Totally 	silent, totally joyless, but exquisitely executed. We see 	that Maxine is one of the anonymous dancers. Her face is 	void of expression. Malkovich laughs. 				 (') 		 Faster! Faster, my little trained 		 monkeys! 	The crowd dances faster and faster.

She puts her arm around him and leads him toward the 	elevator. 				 		 love you, Lotte. 	We come on very close to Craig's arm as he lifts it to put 	it around Lotte.

That's the usual? 				 		 Don’t let the girly shit fool you. 		 It'd blow your shorts off. 	Maxine downs it like a shot of whiskey. She pushes the 	empty glass to the bartender.

The bartender walks away with the empty glass. 				 		 ’m not a homosexual. just like 		 women for more than their bodies. 		 guess you could say 'm the new 		 American male.

Craig does a 	pretty fair impersonation of Maxine's voice. 				 			 (as Maxine, fascinated) 		 Tell me, Craig, why do you love 		 puppeteering? 			 (as Craig) 		 Well, Maxine, 'm not sure exactly. 		 Perhaps it's the idea of becoming 		 someone else for a little while. 		 Being inside another skin. Moving 		 differently, thinking differently, 		 feeling differently. 			 (as Maxine) 		 Interesting. Would you like to be 		 inside my skin, Craig? Think what 		 think? Feel what feel? 			 (as Craig) 		 More than anything. Maxine.

Craig grabs Maxine's hand and drags her into an empty 	office. 									 : 	. - 	Craig pulls Maxine in closes the door. 				 		 It's just, and 've never done 		 this before, Maxine, but it's just 		 that feel something for you. 've 		 never felt this before for anyone, 		 not even my wife. My future is with 		 you, Maxine. 				 		 You might want to check those tarot 		 cards one more time. 	Maxine heads for the door. Craig sits on a box. He puts 	his head in his hands and sighs. Across the room he 	notices a very small door with a two by four nailed across 	it. 				 		 Another evil secret of the 7 1/2 		 floor. 	Craig pries the two-by-four off and opens the door. It's a 	dark and wet membranous tunnel inside. 				 		 Holy shit. Maxine is gonna love 		 this. 	Craig lets go of the door and it slams shut. 									 : 	.

Dr. Lester. . . 				 		 Ah, Craig. Just the fellow wanted 		 to see. 			 (proudly spreading his arms) 		 Juicer! Easy as pie.

(laughing) 		 That's right, Wendy, it is against 		 floor policy, but as long as you're 		 here, let me tell you what know 		 about our cute little door friend. 		 Many years ago, this very office 		 was occupied by a kindly old 		 watchmaker named Mr. White. 									 : 	. ' - 	An old man toils away in the dusty office.

The door slams shut behind him. 									 : 	. - 	It's dark and wet. The walls are soft and membranous. 	There is a dripping sound. Craig crawls along. Soon 	something starts to pull Craig as if he is being sucked 	through a straw. There is a flash of light. 									 : 	. - 	The of someone reading a newspaper.

The image starts to fade, then suddenly goes black. 									 : 	. - 	It’s on the side of Jersey Turnpike. There is a “pop” and 	Craig falls from nowhere into the ditch.

Maxine stands, puts some stuff in her purse. 				 		 Don't you want to know what happened 		 to me? 				 			 (considers) 		 No. 	Maxine heads for the door. Craig grabs her arm. 				 		 This is important! 				 			 (looking at his hand on her arm) 		 It better be. 	Craig sits Maxine down in a chair, lets go of her arm. 				 		 There's a tiny door in that empty 		 office.

You see the world through John 		 Malkovich's eyes, then, after about 		 fifteen minutes, you're spit out into 		 a ditch on the side of The New Jersey 		 Turnpike. 				 		 Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is 		 John Malkovich? 				 		 He's an actor. One of the great 		 American actors of the 20th century. 				 		 What's he been in? 				 		 Lots of things. He's very well 		 respected. That jewel thief movie, 		 for example. The point is that this 		 is a very odd thing, supernatural, 		 for lack of a better word. It raises 		 all sorts of philosophical questions 		 about the nature of self, about the 		 existence of the soul. Am me? Is 		 Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha 		 right, is duality an illusion? Do 		 you see what a can of worms this 		 portal is? don't think can go 		 on living my life as have lived 		 it. There's only one thing to do. 		 Let's get married right away. 				 		 Is this Malkovich fellow appealing? 				 		 Yes, of course. He's a celebrity. 				 		 Good. We'll sell tickets. 				 		 Tickets to Malkovich? 				 		 Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop. 				 		 But there's something profound here, 		 Maxine, we can't exploit it. 				 		 Fine. 'll do it myself. was going 		 to offer a partnership to you, but 		 this way it's more money for me.

At the far end there 	is what amounts to a candle-lit shrine to John Malkovich. 	The centerpiece of the shrine is an enormous photograph 	of Malkovich bordered by a garland of flowers. Lotte stares 	at it for a moment, then drops to her knees in front of it. 									 : 	. ' - 	Lotte has just taken a shower. She towels herself dry in 	much the same way as Malkovich.

'm John. didn't think was going 		 to come, but felt oddly compelled. 		 have to admit was a bit intrigued 		 by your voice. 				 (..) 		 God, she's beautiful. The way she's 		 looking at me. At him. At us. 				 		 And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, 		 my voice is probably the least 		 intriguing thing about me. 				 (..) 		 've never been looked at like this 		 by a woman. 				 		 Can get you a drink? 				 		 Whatever you're having. 									 : 				. ' - 	Craig drives. Lotte is soaking wet. She stares out the 	window. 				 		 So how was it? What was he doing? 				 		 Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging 		 around his apartment. think he must 		 be a lonely man. 				 		 You see, men can feel unfulfilled, 		 too. 'm glad you're realizing that. 		 You shouldn't be so quick to assume 		 that switching bodies would be the 		 answer to all your problems. 				 		 You're right. You know was thinking 		 that we should have Maxine over for 		 dinner. Since you two are partners 		 and all. It might be a nice gesture. 				 		 don't know. There's some tension 		 between us. 'd hate to expose you to 		 that. 				 		 It'll be okay. 'll fix my lasagna. 		 We’ll smoke a joint. 			 (dreamily) 		 Tensions will melt away. 									 : 	. ' - 	Craig, Lotte, and Maxine are seated at the table and eating 	lasagna. Lotte eyes Maxine. Craig eyes Maxine. There is an 	awkward silence. 				 			 (to Maxine) 		 Did you know that Eskimos have not 		 one, but fifty words for snow. It's 		 because they have so much of it. 				 		 After dinner 'll show you my puppets. 				 		 Ah. 				 		 After that 'll introduce you to my 		 favorite monkey, Elijah. He's got an 		 ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood 		 trauma. But we're getting to the 		 bottom of it. 			 (whispers) 		 Psychotherapy. 	There is another silence. 				 			 (to no one in particular) 		 The way see it, the world is divide 		 into those go after what they want 		 and those who don't. The passionate 		 ones, the ones who go after what they 		 want, may not get what they want, but 		 they remain vital, in touch with 		 themselves, and when they lie on 		 their deathbeds, they have few 		 regrets. The ones who don't go 		 after what they want... well, who 		 gives a shit about them anyway? 	Maxine laughs. There is another silence. Suddenly, at the 	same moment, both Craig and Lotte lunge for Maxine and 	start kissing her passionately about the face and neck. 	They stop just as suddenly and look at each other. 				 		 You? 	Lotte looks away. 				 		 Craig, just don't find you 		 attractive. And, Lotte, 'm smitten 		 with you, but only when you're in 		 Malkovich. When looked into his 		 eyes last night, could feel you 		 peering out. Behind the stubble and 		 the too-prominent brow and the male 		 pattern baldness, sensed your 		 feminine longing peering out, and 		 it just slew me. 				 			 (disgusted) 		 My God. 	Lotte strokes Maxine's face. Craig clears dishes from the 	table. 				 			 (to Lotte, removing her hand) 		 Only to John, sweetie. 'm sorry. 			 (gets up) 		 Thanks for a wonderful dinner. 			 (walks past kitchen. to Craig) 		 No hard feelings, partner. 	Maxine exits. Craig and Lotte look at each other. 				 		 want a divorce. 									 : 	. ' - 	It is deadly silent. Craig and Maxine sit at their desks. 	The wall clock ticks. Craig whistles tunelessly, every 	once in a while looking up and discreetly checking out 	Maxine. Eventually there is a knock at the door. 				 			 (a little too urgently) 		 Come in! 	Erroll, a sad, fat young man enters meekly. 				 		 Hello, 'm here about the ad. 				 		 Please, have a seat. 	Erroll sits in a chair in front of Craig's desk. He 	glances nervously over at Maxine. 				 		 When you say, can be somebody 		 else, what do you mean exactly? 				 		 Exactly that. We can put you inside 		 someone else's body for fifteen minutes. 				 		 Oh, this is just the medical 		 breakthrough 've been waiting for. 		 Are their any side effects? Please 		 say no! Please say no! 				 		 No. 				 		 Long term psychic or physiological 		 repercussions? 				 		 No. Don't be an ass. 				 		 Can be anyone want? 				 		 You can be John Malkovich. 				 		 Well that's perfect. My second 		 choice. Ah, this is wonderful. 		 Too good to be true! You see, 'm 		 a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, 		 've tried all the diets, my friends. 		 Lived for a year on nothing but 		 imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? 		 You be the judge. But Malkovich! 		 King of New York! Man about town! 		 Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant! 		 The Schopenhauer of the 20th century! 		 Thin man extraordinaire! 				 		 Two hundred dollars, please. 				 		 Yes. Yes. thousand times, yes! 	Erroll takes out his wallet. 									 : 	. - 	Craig waits by his car, checks his watch. ""Pop!"" Erroll 	plops into the ditch, wet and unkempt. He looks around, 	sees Craig, charges him with a yell and gives him an 	enormous bear hug. 				 		 Oh, thank you! Thank you! 		 Thousand times, thank you! 				 			 (gasping for air) 		 Tell your friends. 				 		 Oh, will, and have many, 		 many friends and associates, my 		 friend. All, by the way, in Overeaters 		 Anonymous. All of them fat and alone 		 like me, all of them dream of being 		 someone else, all of them with John 		 Malkovich as their second choice! 									 : 	. 7 1/2 - 	The hall outside Craig and Maxine's office sports a long 	line of crouching fat people, all clutching cash in their 	hands. 									 : 	. ' - 	Craig kneels at the door and peeks out through the mail 	slot. Maxine sits at her desk and files her toenails. 				 		 This is amazing! We're gonna be rich! 				 		 So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein. 	Craig unlocks the door. Lester steps in, closes the door 	behind him, locks it. 				 		 You're making a big mistake, Schwartz. 			 (nods to Maxine) 		 Ma'am 				 		 Dr. Lester, don't know what you're 		 talking about. 				 		 There are rules, boy, procedures, 		 etiquette. This is not a toy. 've 		 been waiting seventy years to utilize 		 this room, grooming myself, quietly 		 setting the stage, performing 		 ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all 		 his motion pictures again and again. 		 Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping 		 properly. 				 		 You're insane. 				 		 am not alone. There are others. We 		 are legion. You will pay for this 		 blasphemy. You will pay dearly. 	Lester exits. Craig looks at Maxine. There is a moment 	of tension. Finally: 				 		 Crackpot. 	Craig opens the door. The first few fat people move noisily 	into the room. 									 : 	. . ' - 	Many cloaked people in the room kneeling with candles in 	hand before the lit photo of Malkovich. Lotte kneels in the 	back row. They chant: 				 		 How much do we love you? We loved 		 you in ""Making Mr. Right."" That is 		 how much we love you. We even own the 		 director's cut on laser disc. Please 		 accept us into your head as we have 		 accepted you into our hearts. Please 		 let us be you. Amen. 									 : 	. ' - 	The worshippers mill about, chatting, drinking coffee, 	nibbling on cookies. 				 		 May have your attention, please. 		 We have a new disciple among us tonight. 				 		 Hallelujah. 				 		 She is the wife of Schwartz. 	 stunned hush falls over the group. 				 			 (apologetically) 		 'm getting divorced. 				 		 No you mustn't, my child. 				 		 But why, Son of Malkovich? 				 		 We need you on the inside, my child. 		 To report on his comings and goings, 		 and if need be, to... destroy him... 			 (hands Lotte a gun) 		 ...for lack of a better word. 									 : 	.

've been 		 thinking. Let's try to work this out. 		 We've got so much history. 				 			 (still packing) 		 You should feed your animals. They're 		 looking peaked. 				 		 'm getting rid of the fucking 		 animals. 				 		 What? 				 		 'm getting rid of the animals. 've 		 lost interest. Besides, they're 		 standing between you and me. 				 		 No they're not. 				 		 You've always hated the animals. 				 		 You've always loved the animals. 				 		 'm giving them up. 've changed. 		 've found a new focus. 				 		 What's that? 				 			 (beat) 		 Us, of course. 	Craig looks up from his packing. He and Lotte stare at each 	other for a long while. 				 			 (tenderly) 		 Oh, Lot... 	They hug. 				 (') 		 What about Maxine? 				 		 Fuck Maxine. 				 		 We wish. 	They look at each other and laugh, them fall back into the 	embrace. They both get faraway looks in their eyes. 									 : 	. ' - 	The clock reads 3:00 . Craig, in his pajamas, is working 	the Craig and Maxine puppets. They make love on the bare 	puppet stage. Craig seems possessed. 									 : 	. ' - 	The phone rings. Maxine sleepily picks it up. 				 		 Yes? 				 (..) 		 have to see you. Can you call him 		 and invite us over? 				 		 When? 				 (..) 		 Give me one hour to get inside him 		 Exactly. 	Maxine checks her alarm clock. The time is 3:11 . 									 : 	. ' - 	Lotte drives. 									 : 	. ' - 	The doorbell rings. Maxine, in a sheer black nightgown, 	answers it. John Malkovich stands there. 				 		 Thanks so much for coming over. 				 		 Oh, 'm really glad you called. 	Maxine gestures for him to enter. As Malkovich passes by 	her, she checks the wall clock. The time is 3:50. 									 : 	. ' - 	Lotte sits on the floor in the dark. She leans, out of 	breath, against the wall next to the portal and checks her 	watch. The time is 4:10. She pulls open the door. 									 : 	. ' - 	Maxine and Malkovich sit a bit awkwardly next to each other 	on the couch. 				 		 So, do you enjoy being an actor? 				 		 Oh sure. It's very rewarding... 	The digital clock on the clicks over to 4:11 . 	Maxine's look softens, and she kisses Malkovich hard 	on the lips. He seems surprised, but quickly warms to 	it. We shift top Malkovich's as Maxine begins to 	unbutton Malkovich's shirt. 				 (..) 		 Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart. 				 		 love you, Lotte. 				 (..) 		 Maxine... 				 			 (stopping) 		 'm sorry, did you just call me 		 ""Lotte""? 				 		 Do you mind? 				 			 (thinking) 		 No, guess not. 'm an actor. 	They get back to it. 				 		 Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte. 				 			 (thinks he's playing along) 		 Yes, Maxine, yes. 				 (..) 		 This is too good to be true. 									 : 	.

She is soaking wet and breathes heavily. She 	just lies there. 									 : 	. ' - 	Craig is hunched over a cup of coffee. The front door 	can be heard to open. After a moment Lotte appears in 	the kitchen doorway. She is caked with dirt. Craig 	looks up at her. 				 		 You were him last night, weren't you? 				 			 (quietly) 		 Yes. 				 		 And he was with her. 				 		 We love her, Craig. 'm sorry. 				 		 We? 				 		 Me and John. 				 		 Don't forget me. 				 		 Well, you have the Maxine action 		 figure to play with. 	Craig looks down at his coffee. 				 (') 		 'm sorry. That was nasty. 				 		 Life is confusing, isn't it? 				 		 Sometimes we're forced to make 		 hard decisions.

Maxine sits at her 	desk, actually looking kind of radiant. 				 		 You're late. 				 		 Are you torturing me on purpose? 				 			 (matter of fact) 		 've fallen in love. 				 		 don't think so. 've fallen in 		 love. This is what people who've 		 fallen in love look like. 				 		 You picked the unrequited variety. 		 Very bad for the skin. 				 		 You're evil, Maxine. 				 		 Do you have any idea what its like 		 to have two people look at you with 		 total lust and devotion through the 		 same pair of eyes? No don't suppose 		 you would. It's quite a thrill, Craig. 	Craig turns and walks out the door. 									 : 	. 7 1/2 - 	Craig hurries past a long line of fat people, all looking 	eager, all clutching cash. 									 : 	. ' - 	Lester sits at his desk.

Dr. Lester, everything's falling 		 apart. 									 : 	. - 	Craig is at the counter buying a pistol. 									 : 	. - - 	Lester and Lotte sit at a table.

But now we've lost access to Craig. 				 			 (laughs) 		 My child, don't think its a great 		 mystery what Craig's up to. 									 : 									 : 	.

Craig holds the gun to her head. 				 		 'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed 		 to cherish me forever. Now you hold 		 a gun to my head? 				 		 Yeah, well welcome to the nineties. 				 		 Suck my dick! 				 			 (slapping her) 		 Shut up! 	Lotte is stunned. She feels the muzzle against her forehead. 	She shuts up. Keeping the gun trained on Lotte, Craig 	dials the phone. He hands the receiver to her. He holds his 	ear to the receiver also. 				 (') 		 Tell her you need to see her. 				 			 (to Craig) 		 You bastard. 	Craig cocks the pistol. 				 (..) 		 .. Inc.

Alrighty, 		 'll track down Lover-boy, and 'll 		 see both of you in one hour. 		 Exactamundo. 	Maxine hangs up. Lotte hands the phone to Craig, who hangs 	it up. Craig opens up the big cage where Elijah is housed, 	and motions with the gun for Lotte to enter. 				 			 (screaming) 		 Help! He's locking me in a cage! 	Craig slaps Lotte hard. She looks at him, almost sadly. 				 		 Shut up! 				 		 Shut up! 				 		 Lesson number one: Be careful what 		 you teach your parrot. 	Craig tapes Lotte's mouth, ties her hands and feet. Elijah 	watches him tie her. He becomes somewhat agitated, and 	holds his stomach. 									 : 	. - 	Malkovich is rehearsing some business on stage. Maxine 	watches from the house. She anxiously checks her watch, 	then points to it so Malkovich can see. 				 		 Tommy, can take fifteen? 									 : 	.

She eats as Craig slumps down next to the 	cage, gun in hand. 				 		 It was lovely being you being 		 Malkovich, my dear. 'd never seen 		 the passionate side of sweet Maxine 		 before, or her actual tits for that 		 matter. If only, 've been thinking 		 to myself, if only could actually 		 feel what Malkovich feels, rather 		 than just see what he sees... And 		 then, dare say it, if only could 		 control his arms, his legs, his 		 pelvis, and make them do my bidding. 				 		 It'll never happen, fuckface. 				 		 Ah, but you're forgetting one thing, 		 Lambchop. 				 		 What's that? 				 		 'm a puppeteer. 	Craig picks up the phone and dials.

The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy. 									 : 	. - 	Malkovich, in a baseball cap and sunglasses, leans against 	the wall.

Maxine and 	a few other people climb out. The last to emerge is 	Malkovich. He is astounded by the dimensions of the floor. 	He turns the corner and sees the long line of crouching fat 	people. Maxine goes into the office and closes the door. 	Maxine sees "".. Inc."" stenciled on the office door. He 	turns to the first fat man and line. 				 		 Excuse me, what type of service does 		 this company provide? 				 		 You get to be John Malkovich for 		 fifteen minutes. Two hundred clams. 				 			 (quietly flipped) 		 see. 				 		 No cutting, by the way. 	Malkovich pounds on the door. 				 (') 		 No cutting! 	Several fat people jump on Malkovich, and start beating 	him. Craig steps out of the office. 				 		 Hey! Break it up!

You? Why 'm sure it would pale in 		 comparison to the actual experience. 				 		 Let me try! 				 		 Let him try. 				 		 Of course, right this way, Mr. 		 Malkovich. Compliments of the house. 	Craig ushers Malkovich to the portal door, opens it. 				 			 (repulsed by the slime) 		 Jesus. 	Malkovich climbs in. The door closes. 				 		 What happens when a man climbs 		 through his own portal? 				 			 (shrugs) 		 How the hell would know? wasn't 		 a philosophy major. 									 : 	. - 	Malkovich crawls through. It's murky.

It's scary: giant toads, swirling eddies of garish, colored 	lights, naked old people pointing and laughing, black velvet 	clown paintings. 									 : 	. - 	Malkovich pops into a chair in a swakn night club. He's 	wearing a tuxedo. The woman across the table from him is 	also Malkovich, but in a gown. He looks around the 	restaurant. Everyone is Malkovich in different clothes. 	Malkovich is panicked. The girl Malkovich across the 	table looks at him seductively, winks and talks. 				 		 Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich 		 Malkovich... 	Malkovich looks confused. The Malkovich waiter approaches, 	pen and pad in hand, ready to take their orders. 				 		 Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich? 				 		 Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich 		 Malkovich.

The waiter jots it down on his pad. 				 		 Malkovich. 	Malkovich pushes himself away from the table and runs for 	the exit. He passes the stage where a girl singer Malkovich 	is singin sensuously into the microphone. She is backed by a 	'40's style big band of Malkoviches. 				 		 Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich 		 Malkovich... 	Malkovich flies through the back door. 									 : 	. - 	Malkovich lands with a thud in the ditch. Craig is waiting 	there with his van.

Malkovich looks up. beer can comes flying out of the car 	and hits him on the head. 									 : 	. ' - 	Craig is feeding the animals. His gun is stuck in his pants. 	He gets to Lotte's cage.

The sound of running feet, huffing frantic breathing. We 	watch from up in a tree (Elijah's ) as two men in safari 	suits chase a couple of chimps across the jungle floor. The 	chimps are screaming as the safari men tackle them and tie 	them up. The safari men laugh. 				 		 Well, there monkeys ain't going 		 nowhere. Let's get us a couple a 		 brews 'fore the boss comes back... 	The safari men leave the chimps on the ground. We descend 	from the trees to the ground next to the bound chimps. One 	of the chimps looks at the camera. He grunts and squeals. 				 ( ) 		 Son, untie your mother and me! 		 Quickly! Before the great bald 		 chimp-men return. 	 small pair of chimp hands enter into the frame and 	struggle to untie the ropes, but to no avail. Chimp two 	speaks. 				 ( ) 		 Hurry, Elijah! 				 		 Why you little bastard! 	Elijah is wrestled to the ground amidst much screaming. 									 : 	. ' - 	Elijah shakes off the memory and looks determinedly at the 	ropes on Lotte's hands.

Lotte unlocks 	the cage, and dials the phone. 				 		 Maxine! Listen: It hasn't been me 		 in John the last three times. Craig's 		 had me locked up in the apartment.

Malkovich tenses up, then shakes his head in an awkward, 	puppet-like manner. When Malkovich speaks, it seems to be 	against him will. 				 		 Yes. How did you know it was me? 				 		 Lotte called me. 				 		 Oh, so the bitch escaped. 				 		 Apparently you can control this 		 Malkovich fellow now. 				 		 'm getting better all the time. 				 		 'll say you are.

Malkovich begins undressing, and does a lewd bump and grind 	while looking mortified. Maxine giggles. Malkovich (Craig) 	laughs wildly. 									 : 	. ' - 	Lester's hand is in a bloody bandage.

No, you don't understand. 've been 		 inside Malkovich when 'm with 		 Maxine... 				 			 (slaps Lotte furiously) 		 What?! That is not allowed. My God, 		 you are supposed to be one of us.

We will take a wife, a woman 		 of uncommon beauty and intellect, who 		 is, as yet, still an infant herself. 	We see a photo of another infant, this one with a ribbon in 	her hair.

You mean with Malkovich? 				 		 'd love to see your work. 				 			 (pleased) 		 Really? Yeah. Okay. 	Malkovich leans over and kisses her, then gets up. 				 (') 		 'll do something call ""Craig's 		 Dance of Despair and Disillusionment."" 	Malkovich performs the same dance that the Craig pupper 	did at the beginning of the film.

You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing 		 with dolls. 				 		 You're right, my darling, it's 		 so much more. It's playing with 		 people! 	Malkovich kisses Maxine. She snuggles close to him. 				 		 Stay in him forever? 				 			 (as Malkovich, screaming) 		 No! 			 (as Craig, calmly) 		 But how will we make a living, 		 my love, if our clientele doesn't 		 have access to our product? 				 		 Well, we'll have all the money in 		 Malkovich's bank account, plus he 		 still gets acting work occasionally. 				 			 (as Malkovich, breaking through) 		 No! Please! 			 (as Craig, to Malkovich) 		 Shut up, will you? We're trying to 		 think here. 			 (to Maxine) 		 It is sort of like being a puppeteer. 		 like that about it. 				 		 No one would ever have to know its 		 not him. 				 			 (an idea) 		 Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? 		 What if we presented Malkovich as the 		 world's most complicated puppet and 		 me as the only puppeteer sophisticated 		 enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor 		 with the Great Mantini!

(kissing him) 		 It's okay, my sweet. 	They go back to filling the portal. There is the sound 	of many shuffling feet in the hallway.

Lotte lunges for Malkovich. Lester grabs her arm, holds 	her back. 				 		 No! Don't harm the vessel! 				 		 It's Craig in there, can tell. 				 		 understand, but we must protect 		 the vessel at all costs. 			 (to Malkovich) 		 Please, Craig, please step aside 		 and allow us to have what is 		 rightfully ours. 				 		 Squatter's rights, Lester. 	Craig laughs somewhat maniacally. Maxine slips her arm 	through Craig's, joins him in his laughter, and glances 	triumphantly over at Lotte. 				 		 Now excuse us, we have an 		 entertainment legend to create. 				 			 (to the cult members) 		 Clear the way for them, my friends. 		 They will be dealt with in due time. 	The Malkovichians grumble and let Malkovich and Maxine 	exit.

The Malkovichians converge on the sealed portal, and 	begin clawing desperately at the quick-drying cement. 	Fingers are scraped raw, and we see smears of blood and 	skin on the rough gray surface. 									 : 	. ' - 	 slick-looking agent answers a buzzing phone. 				 		 Of course, send him right in.

Lester peers through the door. 				 		 Well, let's see what we've got 		 here. 	Lester crawls into the tunnel, the door slams behind 	him. 									 : 	. - 	Lester crawls through.

(') 			 (grudgingly) 		 Pretty good though. 	Malkovich does an amazing triple somersault, lands on one 	knee and, with spread arms, begins singing: ""Kiss Today 	Goodbye."" in a beautiful tenor. The orchestra catches up 	with him. The audience goes wild. pretty-boy young man 	with a big tousle of black hair and a shiny, tight suit 	appears at the back of the house. An usher glances over at 	him. 				 		 Oh, Mr. Mantini! We weren't expecting 		 you tonight, sir. Um, 'm afraid 		 there's not an empty seat in the 		 entire house. 				 			 (not taking his eyes from the stage) 		 Make one empty. 				 		 -y-y-es sir. 	The usher looks nervously around for someone to boot. 	Martini waits in the back. On stage, Malkovich is now 	performing the ""back of the car scene"" from ""On The 	Waterfront."" He alternates between the Marlon Brando part 	and the Rod Steiger part, moving back and forth from one 	stool to the another. He performs it magnificently. We see 	Lester in the audience wiping a small tear from his eye. 				 		 Not too shabby. 	Mantini is now sitting in a good aisle seat next to a 	beautiful woman. Her boyfriend is being hauled toward the 	exit by the usher. The beautiful woman watches, with some 	concern, as the boyfriend is taken away. Then she turns and 	smiles flirtatiously at Mantini. Mantini smiles back. On 	stage Malkovich is dressed in a ringmaster's outfit and 	juggling chainsaws. 				 		 Nothing more than a Goddamn clown. 	At this point the entire audience stands and gives Malkovich 	a spontaneous standing ovation. All except Mantini. Even the 	cultists get up. 									 : 	. - 	Lotte sits sadly in the wet tunnel.

Truman puppet and Craig Schwartz's actual-size John 	Malkovich puppet in Peter Shaffer's ""Equus."" 									 : 	. - 	The house is packed. On stage is a minimalist set: wood 	planks and metal poles. Six guys in brown turtlenecks and 	stylized wire horse heads mill about. The 60 foot Harry . 	Truman puppet is pacing, his strings extending up into the 	flyspace and out of sight. Malkovich sits on a bench. Truman 	and Malkovich both take stabs at British accents. 				 . 		 Do you dream often? 				 		 Do you? 				 . 		 It's my job to ask the questions. 		 Yours to answer them. 				 		 Says who? 				 . 		 Says me. Do you dream often? 				 		 Do you? 	We see the audience fidgeting in their seats, coughing. 									 : 	. - 	The dialogue drones on as Maxine watches coolly from the 	wings. She drags on a cigarette. Mr. Flemmer, dressed as 	a stagehand, stands behind Maxine. He also watches the 	actors, with an occasional sideways glance at Maxine. 				 			 (without turning around) 		 Keep your eyes in your pants, old 		 timer. 									 : 	. - 	It's intermission. The lobby is crowded. Maxine moves 	through the crowd listening to snippets of conversation. 	Flemmer, now in a tuxedo, moves about also. First couple: 				 #1 		 That Truman puppet is downright 		 boring as the psychiatrist. 				 #2 		 It's a wooden performance, really. 		 Get it? Wooden? 	Second couple: 				 #3 		 What's with the Malkovich puppet? 		 He was much better in Vegas when he 		 played the piano with his feet. 				 #4 		 hate it when they try to stretch. 		 It's like Woody Allen. 	Third couple: 				 #5 		 They both stink! 'm going across the 		 street to second act Miss Saigon. 									 : 	. - 	Malkovich watches himself in his dressing table mirror. 	Maxine enters, flops herself down on the couch and lights 	up a cigarette. 				 		 You'd better turn on the pyrotechnics, 		 lover, 'cause right now you're running 		 neck and neck with the dead president. 		 And you're both in last place. 	Malkovich continues to watch himself in the mirror, nods his 	head. 									 : 	. - 	Mantini leans against a rail and smokes a cigarette. Charles 	Nelson Reilly, in a tuxedo, confers with him in hushed tones. 				 		 You're doing beautifully, my boy. 		 wept at the speech about your wife. 	Flemmer materializes behind Mantini 				 		 What the hell? Nyong-nyong! 	Mantini spins around to face Flemmer. Reilly makes a break 	for it. Flemmer points a finger and Reilly freezes in 	mid-strut. Flemmer then points a finger at Mantini, and he, 	too, freezes. Flemmer picks up the giant wooden controls 	for the marionette, and pulls a copy of the play from his 	pocket. 									 : 	. - 	We watch the second act in progress. The Truman puppet pace 	as he delivers a monologue. Somehow he doesn't even seem to 	be a puppet anymore, so subtle and graceful are his 	movements and the changes in his facial expressions. It's 	as if there's a giant actual Harry Truman on stage. 				 . 		 can hear the creature's voice. It's 		 calling me out of the black cave of 		 the Psyche. shove in my dim little 		 torch, and there he stands -- waiting 		 for me. He raises his matted head.

Totally, infallibly, inevitably 		 account for Me? ... Poor Dr. Dysart!' 	Malkovich watches impressed and a little scared by this 	bravura performance. He glances out into the audience and 	sees a silent, rapt crowd. 									 : 	. - 	Malkovich is delivering a monologue. Acting up a storm. 	During Malkovich's speech, Truman repeatedly attempts to 	upstage him, nodding his head, looking thoughtful, raising 	his ten foot eyebrows in surprise... 				 		 Eyes! ... White eyes -- never closed! 		 Eyes like flames -- coming -- coming! 		 ... God seest! ... God seest! ... ! 									 : 	. - 	 man hole cover is pushed off. Lotte climbs out onto the 	street. She is dirty but determined. 									 : 	. - 	Malkovich is in convulsions on the floor. Big dramatic 	convulsions. Truman scoops him up, and places him on the 	bench. Malkovich continues with the convulsions, milking 	it. Truman speaks. 				 . 		 Here ... Here ... Sssh ... Sssh ... 		 Calm now ... Lie back. Just lie back! 		 Now breathe in deep. Very deep. In ... 		 Out ... In ... Out ... That's it ... 		 In. Out .. In ... Out ... 	Malkovich is breathing insanely now, trying to keep the 	focus on himself. Flemmer is in the catwalks, watching the 	crowd. The audience is watching Malkovich. 				 			 (to his wife) 		 That Malkovich puppet is a damn fine 		 actor. 				 			 (blood boiling) 		 Bastard is stealing my thunder. 	Malkovich and Truman on the stage. Truman is pacing, 	swirling, dancing, juggling enormous bowling pins as he 	talks. 				 . 		 All right! 'll take it away! He'll be 		 delivered from madness. What then? 		 He'll feel himself acceptable! What 		 then? 	Malkovich has upPed his convulsions now. He watches Truman 	out of the corner of his eye while writhing tormentedly on 	the bench. He levitates. Spins in mid-air. Falls on all 	fours and does an uncanny impression of a yelping dog. 	Truman watches Malkovich, continues to speak. But now, when 	he talks, fire comes out of his mouth. 				 . (') 		 'll heal the rash on his body. 'll 		 erase the welts cut into his body by 		 flying manes. 	The audience ""ooohs"" at the flames. Malkovich rips off his 	clothes and convulses into the dying swan-bit from ""Swan 	Lake."" The audience applauds. Truman continues his speech, 	now transforming himself into an actual 60 foot swan and 	flying around the auditorium as he speaks. 				 . (') 		 You won't gallop anymore, Alan. Horses 		 will be quite safe. You'll save your 		 pennies every week, till you can 		 change that scooter into a car... 	The audience watches the giant swan overhead, necks craned, 	in awe. Malkovich sighs. He is out of his league. He goes 	into a remarkable tap dance routine and sings ""Mr. 	Bojangles"", but nobody even looks at the stage. The giant 	swan bursts into flames, flies back onto the stage, burns 	to a crisp, then rises from his ashes as the actual Harry . 	Truman. Truman looks confused and disoriented, as if just 	raised from the dead. 				 		 Where am ? Aren't dead? 			 (possessed) 		 Vote for Mantini! 	Truman grows and grows until he is again just a giant 	puppet. The audience bursts into applause, then delivers a 	standing ovation. Truman bows. Flemmer laughs wildly in the 	catwalks. Malkovich walks dejectedly from the stage. 									 : 	. - 	Malkovich walks past Maxine. She doesn't even look at him. 	Thunderous applause is heard in the background. 				 		 Good-bye, Maxine. 				 		 Whatever. 	Malkovich drops limply to the floor. He lifts his head. 				 			 (weak but relieved) 		 'm back! My nightmare is over. 									 : 	. - 	Flemmer watches Malkovich from above. He pulls out a 	walkie-talkie. 				 			 (into walkie-talkie) 		 Okay, now! 									 : 	. ' - 	Lester is surrounded by all the Malkovichians. He holds 	the walkie-talkie, has just received word. He nods, and 	the Malkovichians crawl in single file into the portal, 	while shrieking a war cry. 									 : 	. - 	Maxine watches as Malkovich pulls himself up off the ground. 	Suddenly, he is again possessed, first by one person, then 	by two, then by three, his body jerking and pulsating with 	each new occupant. It's almost like popping corn, starting 	out slowly, then going faster and faster, until Malkovich 	is possessed by all fifty Malkovichians. He shrieks a war 	cry and runs out onto the stage. 									 : 	. - 	The Truman puppet now hangs limply from the catwalks. 	Malkovich hovers just above the stage and addresses the 	audience. 				 			 (now sounding like fifty voices) 		 am your earthly king! Kneel before 		 me! 	The audience scoffs at first, but then are compelled to 	their knees. 				 			 (like automatons) 		 Hail Malkovich, king of the damned. 	Malkovich laughs, gives the thumbs up sign to Flemmer in 	the catwalks. Flemmer gives the thumbs up sign back. 	Lotte appears in the back of the theater, an out-of-breath 	figure in shadows. It is too late. She runs from the 	theater. 									 : 	. - 	Maxine watches, somewhat amused. She turns and heads for 	the exit. 									 : 	. - 	 dejected Craig walks along the shoulder. He is wet and 	cold. We hold on him for a long while until he eventually 	merges with the landscape. 	 	 	. - 	: 	Something is wrong. It's a typical midtown street, but 	everything is painted gray: the buildings, the streets, 	the sidewalks, the cars. People walk along the streets, 	carrying gray briefcases, wearing gray jumpsuits. Nobody 	talks, nobody smiles. Gray birds fly silently in the sky. 	There is no noise whatsoever. There are several movie 	theaters on the block. All marquees advertise John Malkovich 	movies. Around the corner comes Malkovich. He is floating 	about ten feet off the ground on an enormous, bright red, 	jeweled throne. He wears a gold crown and purple silk robe 	and smiles condescendingly, majestically. Floris sits on his 	lap. She is dressed in an orange satin gown. Nobody on the 	street looks up. 				 			 (fifty voices) 		 Greetings, my lowly subjects. 				 		 Great things, my lonely subtext? 				 			 (rolls his eyes) 		 Boy, be careful what you wish for. 			 (to Floris) 		 Never mind, dear. Just enjoy the ride, 		 will you? 	Floris shrugs, picks at her finger nails. 				 (') 			 (to the people on the street) 		 am bored. You will dance for your 		 king now. 	Without pause the entire street of gray clad people breaks 	into a meticulously choreographed production number. Totally 	silent, totally joyless, but exquisitely executed. We see 	that Maxine is one of the anonymous dancers. Her face is 	void of expression. Malkovich laughs. 				 (') 		 Faster! Faster, my little trained 		 monkeys! 	The crowd dances faster and faster. Older people fall over, 	exhausted, clutching their hearts. Nobody stops dancing to 	help, nobody dares. 									 : 	. - 	Bird's eye view of the park. It's all painted gray. Every 	tree, every leaf. There's no sign of life. The camera moves 	in, through some gray trees and gray brush to: 	 	This place is filled with life: Colorful birds, lizards, 	cats, a rooster. All the animals are active, happy, but 	totally silent, as if they know the precariousness of their 	position. Lotte and Elijah sit among them. These are the 	animals that she freed earlier. Lotte and Elijah hold hands 	and look into each other's eyes. We see that they both wear 	gold bands. They are husband and wife. Elijah signs. 				 () 		 Must you take this terrible demon 		 on yourself, my love? 				 		 Yes. 'm the only one. have to enter 		 Malkovich and destroy him from the 		 inside. If not me, who? 				 () 		 If there was any way could go in 		 your place. But 'm only a monkey 		 and... 				 			 (puts finger to his lips) 		 Hush, sweetheart. 	Lotte slips into a gray jumpsuit. She stuffs a homemade bomb 	on her pocket. She and Elijah kiss passionately, then 	embrace. 				 			 (to the animals) 		 'll be with you always, my friends. 		 Who knows, maybe if 'm lucky, 'll 		 rejoin you with wings and a beak. 				 () 		 Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings 		 and a halo. 	Lotte turns quickly. This is too much to bear. She descends 	into a storm drain. The animals stop what they're doing. 				 			 (softly) 		 Good-bye. Good-bye. 									 : 	. - - 	 man-hole cover lifts. Lotte pokes her head out. The coast 	is clear. She emerges. Assumes the dead-eyed expression of 	the others, and enters the building. 									 : 	. - 	Lotte watches the floors change. After seven, she presses 	the emergency stop button. The elevator jerks to a halt. 	She picks up the crow bar in the corner, pries open the 	door. The 7 1/2 floor is gone. Nothing is there but pipes 	and wires and beams. She climbs out onto the floor. 									 : 	. - 	Lotte searched the floor for some sign of the portal. It 	is nowhere to be found. There is a noise behind her. She 	turns with a start. It's Craig, ragged and ill-shaven. 				 		 My God! 				 		 'm so glad you're safe. You look 		 really wonderful. 				 		 'm in love. For the first time. 		 It's funny, but when it happens to 		 you, there's no question. 				 		 He's a lucky man. 			 (beat) 		 Do know him? 				 		 It's Elijah. 				 		 The iguana? 				 		 The monkey. 				 		 Oh, right. As long as you're happy. 		 'm sure he's a better lover than 		 ever was. 				 		 better friend. 				 			 (beat) 		 'm sorry for everything. 				 			 (pecking him on the cheek) 		 It's okay, Craig. It all worked out, 		 in an odd sort of way. 				 		 You came up here looking for the 		 portal? 				 		 Yeah. was going to kill him from 		 the inside. 				 		 And yourself too in the process. God, 		 you're so beautiful. Why couldn't 		 see that before? 				 		 You saw it once. Now you see it again. 		 That's life, isn't it? And you were 		 up here to try the same thing, weren't 		 you? 				 		 suppose. But they got here first, 		 the lousy bastards. So now it's all 		 over, guess. 				 		 don't know. There's a small 		 community of us. We have a place they 		 don't know about. We're happy. We'll 		 keep trying to figure out a way. Come 		 stay with us. Join the struggle. 				 		 You'll have me, after all 've done 		 to you? 				 		 People make mistakes. 				 		 'm through with puppets, Lotte. 		 just want you to know that. 				 		 know. 				 		 'd like to be a farmer. want to 		 help things grow, to encourage life. 		 Do you and your friends need a farmer? 				 		 Sure. We could really use a farmer. 		 We'd be grateful for the help. 			 (beat) 		 Also, think, you know, if you 		 wouldn't mind too terribly, a little 		 puppet show every once in a while, 		 would do a lot to lift our spirits. 		 You know, if you wouldn't mind too 		 terribly. 	Craig's eyes well up with tears. Lotte looks at him sweetly. 				 (') 		 Oh honey. It's gonna be okay. 	She puts her arm around him and leads him toward the 	elevator. 				 		 love you, Lotte. 	We come on very close to Craig's arm as he lifts it to put 	it around Lotte. We see a thin almost invisible filament. 	We follow it up, and discover that Craig is now a 	marionette being controlled from above by an emotionless 	Mantini in a gray jumpsuit. 				 			 (in Craig's voice) 		 can't wait to see where you and your 		 friends live, Lotte. 				 (..) 		 It's beautiful, Craig, like Eden. 	Now we see filaments attached to Mantini's arms, and w 	follow them up to find that Flemmer is controlling Mantini. 				 		 One serpent, coming up. 	Flemmer throws his head back and laughs. The camera moves 	into his mouth and down his throat, which, oddly enough, 	looks exactly like the membranous John Malkovich portal 	tunnel. 	 : ""Put Your Hand Inside The Puppet Head"" by They 	Might Be Giants.

19,human_nature,Charlie Kaufman,michel gondry,comedy, drama, romance,," . There is a gunshot. crow screams. fluttering of wings. : . - Bird's-eye view. We circle lazily above the forest. Through a break in the trees, we catch an occasional glimpse of a prostrate form on the ground. As the circling camera gets closer we see that the form is a human body. : - 'm not sorry. bead of sweat trickles down her cheek. Then: a blinding flash of light obliterates her face. : - am sorry. tear wells in Puff's eye and runs down his face. Another blinding flash of light. : - don't even know what sorry means anymore. As Nathan speaks, a trickle of blood drips down his face from his out-of-frame forehead. Another blinding flash of light. : . - It's a frenetic hand-held shot as Lila is pulled from a police car and dragged into the precinct house. Cameras flash. Reporters shout questions. Lila attempts to shield her face from view, but she is handcuffed and can only manage to hunch her shoulders. : . - ratty interrogation room. Institutional green walls. Beat-up file cabinets. Dark. bit of fluorescent light spills in through the frosted glass door. Lila, thirties, sits at the end of a long table. reel-to-reel tape recorder whirs in front of her. She is smoking. Three fat, mean-looking cops sit in shadows at the other end of the table. One of the cops eyes her lasciviously. Lila's hand shakes as she brings the cigarette to her mouth. 'm not sorry. So spend the rest of my life in jail. So what? 've been in jail my whole life anyway. jail of blood and tissue and coursing hormones... One of the cops sighs and massages the bridge of his nose. It's going to be a long night. ...a jail called the human body. The lascivious cop smiles lasciviously at Lila's reference to ""human body."" My soul held prisoner in this reeking, stench-ridden bag of bones and entrails. bag of feces and piss and fibroid cysts in my tits and precancerous moles on my sun-damaged back... The lascivious cop gags, then vomits on the floor. Lila drags on her cigarette, calmer now. At least now 'll be able to blame the state, not God, for my incarceration. : . - Puff, thirties, dirty, scraggly hair and beard but in a crisp business suit, testifies before a congressional committee. The auditorium is filled with reporters and spectators. Puff sits in front of a microphone, counsel at his side. He pours himself a glass of water, drinks, clears his throat, then speaks: stentorian, confident. am sorry, gentlemen, sorry for all of us. Your's is a complicated, sad world. This is a revelation to the assembled crowd. People whisper to each other. And never knew that. was living a life of simplicity, of purity, when was ripped out of my Eden and immersed in this harshness. Some would argue that the life was living was not a human life at all. And, gentlemen, don't have any clever retort. am not a philosopher. The only thing know is that am sorry, sorry for my expulsion from Eden, sorry for my Lila rotting in her jail cell, and sorry for Nathan... rotting in his grave. : . - Nathan, thirties, in a white robe, sits alone at a white table. Everything is white except for an oozing bullet wound in Nathan's temple. don't even know what sorry means anymore. It's odd. When was alive knew -- maybe it was all knew -- but here sorry is meaningless. Love is meaningless. Jealousy is meaningless. Ambition is meaningless. Everything that motivated my every breath while was alive is meaningless now. (beat) guess that's how can be sure 'm really dead. : . - Lila watches the slowly churning tape recorder reels, fixated. The cop who vomited is mopping it up. The other two are sipping coffee. Lila talks. My story begins when was twelve. (checks watch) Jesus. : . - It's got that faded, ""memory"" look. Twelve year old Lila hurries home from school, books clutched to her chest. Other kids walk along the street in pairs or groups, laughing and chatting. Lila walks alone, a worried scowl on her face. (..) Something terrible happened when was twelve. : . ' - Colors are still muted. It looks to be somewhere in the early 70's based on the preponderance of Bay City Rollers posters on the wall. Twelve year old Lila enters the room, closes the door, locks it, rattles the doorknob to make sure that the door is really locked. She draws the shades. She pulls some t-shirts from her dresser drawer and stuffs them into the space between the bottom of the door and the floor. (..) (muffled) Hey, no fair! Drop dead, Eric. Lila stands nervously in front of the full-length mirror on her closet door. She takes a deep breath and begins to unbutton her shirt, watching herself carefully in the mirror. (..) Something terrible started to happen to my body when was twelve. My mother said because of it would never be able to get a man, so should get used to the idea of dedicating my life to the pursuit of knowledge, or religion... or whatever. Lila's shirt is now unbuttoned. She pulls it open. She is wearing a training bra over the very beginning of breast buds. On the chest above the bra, and on her stomach below it, is hair. Dark curly hair. She stares at it, touches it cautiously. Then she starts to cry. She crouches into a ball and weeps. (..) The doctor said... : . ' - Old fashioned office. Twelve year old Lila sits on the examination table, her shirt off. An elderly male doctor touches the hair, fingers it. Her mother looks on. (to the mother) It's hormonal. Nature is a funny and complex thing. It could get worse with time. Young Lila turns to the camera. By the time was twenty looked like an ape. : . - The cop who vomited, gags again. Lila stares at him. Her face is hard, blank. She stubs out her cigarette. : . - Puff testifies before the committee. don't think there's anyone in the world who doesn't know by now that was raised in the wilderness by an ape. Well, to be fair, by a man who thought himself an ape, but it amounts to the same thing gentlemen, does it not? : . - . This has a faded, ""memory"" look also. naked, bearded, dirty middle-aged man and a naked, dirty ten year old Puff walk along like apes, crouched over and dragging their knuckles. (..) My father escaped from a New Jersey mental institution in 1963. : . - It's raining and deserted. Puff's father, in pajamas, comes tearing around the corner. He runs crazily towards the camera, waving his arms, puffing out his cheeks. (..) He had been committed the previous year after applying one too many times at our local zoo for the job of ""apprentice ape."" Puff's father passes a newspaper vending machine, stops, goes back and examines the headline. It reads: President Kennedy Assassinated. Puff's father looks heavenward and clutches at his temples in despair. (..) My father saw what the human race had come to while he was... in captivity. He felt something had to be done to create a better world. : . - Puff's father climbs out a second story window with a small bundle in his arms. He runs off into the night. (..) He stole little me from my mother, his ex-wife, and raised me, with love and tenderness and respect, as an ape like himself. : . - Puff looks pointedly at the congressman. Apes don't assassinate their presidents, gentlemen. The congressmen are shamed: they look down, they take notes, they mumble instructions to the assistants seated behind them. : . - An adult Puff and his now older father sit on the forest floor and pick bugs off each other and eat them. (..) Until quite recently believed myself to be an ape, although didn't know specifically what type. Apes don't think in terms of type. : . - Puff testifies. It might be argued, gentlemen, that apes don't even know that they are apes. In retrospect, however, 'd say that was a pygmy chimp. Puff holds up an illustration of a pygmy chimp. Several reporters run from the room: a scoop! : . - Nathan talks to nobody in particular. have to say always hated apes. Of course don't any longer. don't even know what hate means now. But while alive, hated apes. blame my parents. mean, don't blame them. don't know what blame is, really, anymore, but think they influenced me in my ape-hating tendencies. : . - Faded colors. Ten year old Nathan in a bow tie and shortpanted suit walks along with his uptight, British parents. They arrive at the ape pen. Nathan is excited. He jumps up and down. The apes jump up and down also. Monkeys! Look, mama, monkeys! (clamping down on his shoulder) Nathan, those are not monkeys. Those are apes. Mountain Gorillas to be precise. There is a commotion off screen. Two uniformed attendants drag Puff's father, straitjacketed and kicking and screaming like an ape, past Nathan and his parents. ' am not a human being! am an animal! Nathan, his father, and the other zoo patrons look on curiously, a little frightened. Nathan's mother chooses to ignore it. And furthermore... Tell him, Harold. (distracted) Uh... (then by rote) We must never act like apes, son. For you see, The ape is our closest biological relative -- specifically the pygmy chimp. (holds up the same illustration of a pygmy chimp that Puff showed the congressional committee) single chromosome separates us. But you know what truly separates us from the apes, what makes us better than apes? No, papa. What? Culture. Civilization. Refinement. If we do not have these as humans, then we might as well be living in pens and throwing our feces about, masturbating in public... (beat, a reverie) ...sniffing red swollen female rump... Enough, Harold. : . - Lila lights a new cigarette with her spent one. She drags. Oh, had sexual urges. had the urge to merge, officers. Inside was 100% Grade female. (laughs derisively) But what self-loathing felt! Who would have someone as repulsive, as unladylike as me? did everything could to shield the world from this repulsiveness. : . - Stockings hang over the shower curtain rod. The window shade is drawn. Towels are stuffed in the space under the door. twenty year old naked Lila is covered with shaving cream, face to feet. She is shaving. There is a pounding on the door. (..) Lila, what are you doing in there? need to get ready for my date. Nothing! 'll be out in a minute! The door opens. Lila freezes. Look, 'll just... (stops in her tracks when she sees Lila) What the...? Lila is mortified. : . - Lila is sitting in her bathrobe on her bed and staring out the window. There is a bit of shaving cream behind her ear. Her roommate runs back and forth getting ready for her date. don't know why you didn't tell me about this. It's embarrassing, okay? It's not so bad. (beat) So, it just keeps growing? Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows. Well, don't jump down my throat. 'm just trying to help. How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly? Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that 'm interested. Why, because 'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles? (pegged) You're fucked up, Lila. (out the door) Why don't you fucking try electrolysis or something? Figure it out for chrissake. The door slams. Lila hugs her knees to her chest. (..) At sixty dollars an hour, electrolysis was not a feasible solution. explored my alternatives. : . - Twelve year old Lila walks sadly through an art museum. she looks at various old portraits of men. She studies their facial hair. When she turns a corner, she is shocked to see a large Renaissance painting of a naked woman entirely covered with fur. She hurries to it. She looks at the placard next to the painting. It is a painting of Mary Magdalene. (..) remember once coming across a painting of Mary Magdalene entirely covered with fur. guess that's where got the idea that maybe the Catholic Church might be a place that encouraged excessive hair growth in its women. . - Lila, in a nun's habit, is on her knees praying. (..) So became a nun. Heavenly Father... (sighs) ...please let this hair go away. (..) But my prayers were always so selfish. : . - bunch of naked women dance and chat around a campfire. Lila is there, pretty hairy. So are many of the other women. (..) tried being a lesbian separatist. (chanting) woman without a man / Is like a fish without a bicycle. (..) But guess just wasn't attracted to women, even hostile, man-hating, hairy ones who wore sensible shoes. : . - Lila, in a full beard, sits on a throne before a crowd of gawking, dumb-looking, mouth-breathing children. Next to her on a separate stage is a sour-looking, middle-aged midget man sitting on a throne, staring blankly into space. (..) For a while was a professional circus freak. : . - Lila, in a Santa suit, with beard sprayed white, sits on a throne in front of a crowd of gawking, dumb-looking, mouth- breathing children. One of them is on her lap. Next to her sits the sour midget, dressed in an elf suit. (..) During the holiday season, they made us wear costumes. (depressed) Ho ho ho. That's not real. The kid pulls Lila's beard. Ow! You little fuck. (..) Aside from the great dental, this occupation was not pleasant. : . - Lila walks home. She's wrapped in winter clothing, but we can still see a bit of her white beard. It's snowing. The street is deserted. She spots a lighted window, she peers in. It's a warm family scene. Large group of chatting, laughing people. Fire in the fireplace. Big turkey on the table. (..) They say the holidays are difficult for a lot of people. Lila looks down the street and sees dozens of lonely-looking people peering forlornly in warmly lit windows. Some on ladders to peer in second-floor windows. Lila sighs. : . - The room is lit with candles. Lila finishes shaving herself all over. Then she takes the double-edged blade out of the razor and climbs into the a bathtub filled with warm water. She is about to slice her wrists. (..) decided there was something poetic about killing myself with a razor blade. On the shelf next to the tub a little gray mouse watches her intently. At first she is startled, but then she and the creature seem to be communing. His little black beady eyes reflect the light. Lila starts to cry. She puts down the blade. : . - Lila wipes a tear from her eye. The way that mouse looked at me. There was no judgement. It didn't care if had hair all over my body. was just what was. felt so free. Do you understand what 'm saying? The cops look up, on the spot. It seems their minds were elsewhere. Something about a mouse, right? Lila sighs. : . - We see a tent in a clearing. smoking campfire. There is a rustling inside the tent. Lila steps out naked. She is covered with fur. She pours a cup of coffee, and stands, comfortable in her skin, watching the world around her. Squirrels jump from tree to tree, birds look down at her. She smiles. (..) Birds and squirrels and rocks and trees didn't seem to judge my hair. felt at peace when there were no humans around. figured out a way to spend as much time as possible with no people around. became a nature writer. Lila picks up a pad and pen from a rock, sits on the rock and writes. : . - woman under a hair drier reads a book intently. We see the first sentence of the chapter: ""Last night almost died on this mountain top."" We hear Lila's dramatic reading competing with the very loud sound of the hair drier. Last night almost died on this mountain top, and the irony is had never felt more alive. : . - There is a violent, violent storm. The hair drier drone has turned into the explosive noise of rain beating down in sheets and wind howling at fifty miles an hour. Branches crack. Lila's tent blows over, revealing her huddled there with a sleeping bag wrapped around her like a blanket. knew it was coming when in late afternoon, a thunderhead drifted over, sneaking in like kids through the back door of a movie theater, forced casual. It turned the sky a queer shade of green. green that said ""watch out, baby, this is gonna hurt like hell."" could've hightailed, but that would be cheating. Part of the Nature experience is recognizing its mastery over you, your smallness in the face of it. Lightning hits a tree nearby. It falls with a smack practically on top of Lila. She screams, then defiantly stands, throwing off the sleeping bag. The wind and rain whip her hair around her head. She laughs with amazing gusto and raise her arms like a runner winning a marathon. As Nietzsche said, what does not kill me makes me stronger, and that goes double if you're a woman. : . - We see many copies of a book entitled ""Wind in my Hair"" by Lila Jute. (..) became a successful nature writer. : . - We see a woman under a hair drier reading ""Wind in my Hair"". We pull back to see that a long row of women under hair driers are reading Lila's book. They all stand defiantly, proudly, knocking their hair driers up and back as they do. The blowing hair driers whip the women's wet hair around their heads. The blowing hair drier drone is unbearably loud. Then became a famous nature writer. said to myself, fuck humanity... : . - big display of the book ""Fuck Humanity"" by Lila Jute. long line of women with beautifully coiffured hair snakes out of the store. ...and became a recluse. had a menagerie of animals at my house. They loved me because was me. They loved me on the days shaved. They loved me on the days didn't. For a while this was enough. : . - Lila lies in bed tapping on a lap top. dog lies with her and licks her knee. She seems to enjoy it, and gets lost in a reverie. The dog morphs into a handsome man, kissing her knee and working his way up her thigh and under her nightgown. Lila is getting seriously hot and bothered. Her head lolls. But the reverie dissipates and the man turns back into a dog rooting around her crotch with his cold nose. She pushes him away. The dejected dog gets off the bed. (..) By the time was thirty was very, very horny. Lila gets out of bed and studies herself in the mirror. She brushes her hands against her hairy body. had to have a man in my... life. At any cost. would become what needed to become to achieve this. would become a hairless lie. The mirror image of Lila shimmers and turns into Lila with no body hair. Lila all made-up and with a smart new hairstyle. She assumes a coquettish pose and smiles cutely at herself. was rich enough for electrolysis by this time, so began the long arduous process of having each inappropriate hair burned out of my body at the root. : . - Lila talks. One of the cops is doodling. One is picking wax from his ear with a pencil. One is reading a paperback novel under the table. This is when everything changed, and this is where my confession really begins. The cops look up. : . ' - Lila lies shirtless on a table while Rose, her fifty year old electrologist, works on her back. Progress! Ouch. Yeah? Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a baby's butt. love it, Rose. 'm getting to be a real girl. You still in the market for a real boy? Always. Ow. (beat) Cause there's this guy. My brother knows him. Might be right up your alley. Tell me. could use someone up my alley. (playing dumb) don't get that. Is that sexual? Shut up and tell me. Handsome, thirties, psychologist... Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals, Rose. Loves animals. Loves you. What do you mean? Somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal- loving psychologist said he would love to meet you. Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he? My brother is discreet. (rubbing her hand over her jaw) Won't he be able to tell? My brother says the guy's a thirty- five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know how women usually feel. Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation. Plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which he is ""mortifyingly ashamed"", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever. God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff. Yeah, well my brother is his shrink. : . - It's a chi-chi place. Lila sits at a table with Nathan, fastidious in dress and manner. There is an awkward firstdate silence. She sneaks a glance at his crotch. Then: Meditations on a Banana Slug was a delightful read. Thank you so much. love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs. As do . They're so even keel. They forge ahead with slow determination. They don't get distracted or side-tracked. They don't care what they look like. They don't care that people look at them and go, ""Ewww. slug."" They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true. You've got to respect that. have to say that 'm not there yet. Where? Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. 'm not there yet. still have many human characteristics. That's not necessarily a bad thing. Yes. suppose not. But still. One would like to move along. To move beyond. 'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me 've tried. 'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to. love that you said that. It makes me feel a bit lighter. 've been rather heavy lately. Thinking about my childhood. Realizing how much a product am of my upbringing. (beat, cautiously) 've been seeing someone. therapist. (feigning surprise) You are a therapist, right? No no. 'm a psychologist, but do research. 'm a behaviorist. work with animals. Mice at the moment. hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan. Heavens no. My work now is... Right now 'm teaching mice... well, table manners, to be candid. (beat. doesn't know what to say) How's it going? Quite well, really. It's a lot of work. lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. Right now 've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course. Paper or cloth? hope you don't think me daft. It's important work. It's part of a larger sociological experiment. 'm federally funded. What's the larger experiment? It's my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice, they can be taught to humans. Going out on a limb, aren't you, Nathan? (speech) The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels. 'm not sure. (stridently) Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse. Rudeness, vulgarity, meanness are the norm. We are animals after all. Ergo if can teach table manners to mice, can teach them to humans. If can teach table manners to humans, can save the world. Nathan blushes. Lila stares at him for a long moment. Her thoughts are unreadable. : . ' - Lila lies on her back. Rose works on her breasts. So? really like him, Rose. He's so... (searching) ...passionate about his work. My brother says he likes you, too. (pleased) Really? Yeah. Says he likes you even more than he likes his own mother. And according to my brother Nathan's abormally close with his mother. : . - Nathan talks. began going to a therapist when was in my thirties, because felt that wasn't enjoying life the way my friends were. (beat) After a time my childhood came up. : . - It is another sepia scene. Nathan as a ten year old sits at the table with his parents. There is a bowl of salad in front of each of them. Everyone's head is bowed in prayer. Lord, we thank you for this bountiful gift we are about to receive. Amen. Eyes open, and young Nathan reaches for a fork to eat the salad. He grabs the wrong fork. Mother's eyes widen in horror. My God, no! My God! (disappointed) Oh, Nathan. Nathan looks up. That is the wrong fork, young man. (to father) Harold, tell the boy. That is the wrong fork, young man. (panicky) 'll use the right one. 'm sorry. forgot. Harold, tell the boy more. Too late. Go to your room. But... Harold! Tell the boy again. (looking at mother) No ""buts."" Go to your room now. (looking at father) And? And think about what you've done. : . ' - Adult Nathan sits on the couch, dabbing at his eyes. Wendall, his therapist sits across from him and writes something in his notebook. And do you think maybe this early childhood indoctrination has something to do with your interest in table manners in the present. Nathan thinks long and hard about this. He seems to be really straining, squinting his eyes. Finally: don't think so. No. Wendall nods and scribbles something on his pad. Why do you ask? Wendall looks up. : . - Everything's white. People in lab coats hustle back and forth. Nathan, also in a lab coat, is hovering over a Lucite encasement. Inside we see two white mice, both attached to electrodes. They sit in little chairs at a little table. In front of each of them is a little plate of salad and three forks of varying size under Lucite domes. Nathan nods to his pretty French assistant, Gabrielle, who presses a button. The Lucite domes over the salads lift. Tentatively both mice reach for a fork. There is a tiny piece of velcro on each mouse's paw and a tiny piece of velcro on each of the forks. The first mouse picks the correct fork, and stabs it into the salad and eats happily, relieved. The second mouse picks the wrong fork. Nathan presses a button, which sends the mouse flying off his chair with an electric shock. The correct mouse keeps eating, unconcerned. Nathan makes a note in his notebook. Gabrielle watches Nathan as he writes, enchanted. : . ' - The table is elegantly set, candlelit. Lila sits at it while Nathan fusses in the kitchenette. Something classical wafts over from the stereo in the living room. Nathan places a salad in front of Lila and sits across from her with his own salad. It looks wonderful. You look wonderful. 'm on top of the world tonight, Lila. Work is going splendidly and my personal life is ... Lila picks up a fork from the inside of her setting, not the outside. Nathan blinks. Lila tastes the salad. Um-mmm. Oh Nathan, this salad is delish... (clenched teeth) My God! The fork! The fork! 'm sorry? (strangely) Tell her, Harold... (stops himself) It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses. Oh, 'm sorry. (picks up correct fork) 'm sorry, Nathan. never really learned those things. (forced casual) No biggie. There is a long silence as they both eat the salad. Boy, this is good! 'm sorry that became so upset. No, 'm sorry. 'm really backward in certain areas. (beat, blurting) It's only that really enjoy your company and... You do? Yes, and... You really enjoy my company? Yes. (beat, blurting) Please don't talk with food in your mouth, Lila. Please. You're so pretty and it only mars your... 'm sorry. 'm being critical. Nathan pounds his forehead with his fist. Lila waves her hand to indicate that it's fine. She doesn't say anything because she's chewing. It's just that have some peculiarities, and... like you, too, Nathan. You do? Yeah (beat) But have some peculiarities also. (happily) don't care. don't care! (then, concerned) Like what, for example? Lila takes a deep breath, about to go into it, thinks better of it. Like nothing. Nathan smiles, relieved. Lila smiles back. Nathan recoils slightly, skittishly half-points to his bared teeth. Apparently there's a piece of food stuck in Lila's teeth. She closes her mouth, runs her tongue over her teeth, smiles again, mouth closed. : . ' - Rose is doing Lila's feet. My brother says things are going really well between you and Nathan. cannot believe how in love am with this man. Yeah? He's so cute. even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something. (beat) Rose, we connect on every level. 've finally found someone can feel completely safe with. Don't throw that away. had that once with a guy. But threw it away for a cheap thrill. One night stand? No. married a midget. Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill? Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear. didn't know you were into that sort of thing. Let me tell you, honey, midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship. They're portable. They're controllable. They're eager. And they're exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor. (screams with delight, then:) have a friend you might like to meet. Oh? Three foot one. Be still my crotch. Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him. Yeah. My brother told me. And think 'm going to. (mulling it over) Stand on a stepladder sometimes. : . - Nathan talks. Lila moved in with me. Did love her? thought so. But from my new vantage point realize that love is nothing more than a messy conglomeration of need, desperation, fear of death, insecurity about penis size, and the self-involved, ego driven need to collect other people's hearts. Not that judge it. (puts head in hands. beat. looks up) Listen, don't want to be dead yet. Is there any way to... Nathan looks around for some sign of another person. There is nobody. No suppose not. (beat) No biggie. Anyway, Lila moved in. We had our problems, but we both wanted love so badly, we turned a blind eye. . ' - Nathan, Lila, and Nathan's parents (looking very, very old) sit at the dining room table. Salad is about to be eaten, and everyone glances sideways over at Lila, waiting for her to make her move. She reaches for the wrong fork, corrects herself and picks the salad fork. Nathan breathes a sigh of relief. His mother looks disappointed, clucks. They eat in silence. Finally: It's lovely to finally meet you, Mr. and Mrs. Bronfman. 've heard so much about you and 've seen you in photographs from Nathan's childhood, but it's nice to meet you in the flesh. must say, you look exactly the same as in the photographs. Thank you, dear. Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible. Nathan! His mother and father touch their faces reflexively, then look at each other and laugh. Tell him, Harold. Son, your mother and are doing a production of The Gin Game at the local community theater. We forgot to take off our make-up. The mother and father laugh again. Then they pull at their latex faces. The wrinkles come off. And they look exactly as they did in the flashback scene, albeit a bit pink-faced. There is another pause. (awkward) Goodness, you two look exactly as you did in those old photos. (cold) Yes, so you mentioned earlier, dear. (changing the subject) Lila's a nature writer, mother. love nature. As long as it stays in the zoo where it belongs. The father and Nathan laugh at mother's joke. Lila joins in weakly, against her better judgment. (to Lila) Don't you agree, dear? Lila hesitates. Of course she does, mother. : . ' - Nathan is in bed, in starched pajamas. He lies on his back under perfect covers and stares straight up at the ceiling. What are you doing in there? (..) (pissy) 'll be out in a minute. 'm sorry about my parents. (..) You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes. was simply attempting to keep the evening light. You know that feel similarly to you about nature. (..) Do you? Of course. (beat) simply love the... naturalness of it all. Lila emerges from the bathroom, radiant, hopeful. Do you? Oh do you, darling? Why certainly! Lila happily leaps into bed. She smothers Nathan with kisses. Oh, darling. 'm so relieved. Let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow! (oh shit) That's a great idea. Nathan kisses her. It'll be wonderful! 'll show you my old stomping grounds! Terrific. Can't wait! Nathan kisses her ear. He looks confused, sticks his finger behind her ear, and pulls it out with a dab of shaving cream on it. Shaving cream? don't think so. (beat) Why? : . - Nathan drives. He's dressed in spanking new, freshly starched safari clothes, big shiny new hiking boots. Lila sits in the front passenger seat. She is dressed in a costume identical to Nathan's, but, as opposed to Nathan, she seems awkward in it. She fidgets in it, straightens it, sighs, comes to terms with it, and looks dreamily out the window at the passing trees. She is home. That's all that matters. Darling, did you bring the insect repellent lotion? Yes, darling. (beat) Oh, and the sun block? Of course. What , sweetie? Fifteen. Perfectomundo! We are ready! (beat) Say, wouldn't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block? Think of all the time one would save. Yes, darling. think 'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that. (beat) Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit? Yes. Flares? Absolutely. We could call it ""Quit Bugging Me, Sunny."" (laughs a lot) Get it? Sunny. -u-n-n-y. (laughs appreciatively) That's very funny. love you so much. : . - Puff testifies. Then, gentlemen, one day saw something hadn't seen since my father died in a freak accident involving a rotted log and four thousand bees stinging his head... saw other human beings. They chattered away at each other in what appeared to be gibberish. Later learned it was English. Now wonder if perhaps my initial assessment hadn't been correct. : . - Puff's : Through some brush we watch Nathan and Lila hiking. We hear Puff's loud heavy breathing and, in the distance, the relentless gibberish chatter of Nathan and Lila. Puff moves. Lila glances over. : . - Lila talks. It was a flash of white. ruled out deer immediately. Too... upright. : . - We're with Lila and Nathan now. Lila has stopped and is peering into the distance. Did you see that? What? don't know. Something. deer? No. Too... upright. Might've been a person. (nervously) It might behoove us to turn back at this point. Lila walks in the direction of the sighting. Come on. (not budging) If it's a person, why should we go see it? It's not like it's nature or anything. It's just a person. (beat) Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen. They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that. Lila trudges through the brush. Nathan follows. Better than being left behind. This is the way to get ticks, Lila. This is it. Bingo! Lyme Disease! You've hit the nail on the head here. Lila is in her element. Her whole demeanor has changed. She is tracking. She sniffs the breeze, cocks her head, moves stealthily. Then she sheds her clothes, almost shaking them off, like a dog shaking off some cute costume his owner had dressed him in. Oh for God's sa... Lila turns her head and glares at Nathan. There is an animal fierceness in her eye that shuts him up instantly. She turns back to pursue her prey. : . - Puff testifies. had never seen anything like it. : . - Puff's : We see a naked Lila looking in our general direction, but not seeing us. The sun dapples her body. She moves closer and closer. (..) It was an ape as had never seen before. Like me, yet different in certain essential details. And all at once felt a heat pass through me. My heart raced. Gentlemen, wanted to touch her, to caress her, to be one with her. had urges and desires could not explain. felt overwhelmed by the power this strange creature had over me, and so did what any animal would do when it comes across an animal of superior strength... : . - The cops are transfixed. He bolted. : . - We are with Lila. She creeps along, when suddenly a tan, muscular figure tears out from behind a tree and runs, practically on all fours, through the dense underbrush. Lila follows, almost as agile as the forest creature. Nathan just stands there. The chase continues. There is a great deal of heaving and panting. Puff shimmies up a large tree. Lila follows. Puff leaps from branch to branch. Lila follows easily. Puff swings from a vine. So does Lila. Finally they come to the end of the trees, a clearing. There is no nowhere for Puff to leap. Lila is with him in the tree. They are crouched, bloody, heaving, on separate branches, staring at each other. After a long moment, Lila speaks. Who are you? Puff cocks his head. The high timbre of her voice surprises him, pleases him, but he doesn't understand the words. You don't understand my language, do you? Puff looks at his crotch. Apparently there is some activity down there. Lila, following his eyes, glances down there also. (laughing) take it back, you do understand my language. Puff grabs for his crotch and begins to play with himself distractedly, looking at her all the while. He falls out of the tree. Lila gasps. Branches crack and snap as he passes through them and then there is an unpleasant thud when he hits the forest floor. Lila shimmies down the tree, and kneels by Puff. He is unconscious. Oh God. Nathan comes limping through the brush. Somehow his safari suit and boots are as clean and pressed as they were in the car. He is carrying Lila's clothes. Somehow he has had time to neatly fold them. Oh my God! Is he dead? Please put something on. Lila looks up at icily at Nathan. You'll catch cold. It's cold. (beat) What do you suppose he is, a survivalist? think he's feral. (jumping back) Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies! He looks perfectly fine. think we should go. Please. Before he wakes up and, don't know, eats us, or whatever feral things do. don't understand you. This is fascinating and you just want to run away. mean, here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want to do is run back to your... (thinking) Actually, just had an amusing thought. What? (musing) Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated? Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal. It's perfect! Nathan, what the hell are you talking about? (doing a little dance) Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. 'm on to stage five: The human subject. Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan. (ranting) Don't you see? He's my Tabula Rasa, my Eliza Dolittle. He's my ticket to the top of the Behaviorist food chain. He's going to make me famous. won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here. Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness? Never to know the love of a good woman, never to revel in the pitter-patter of little feet, never to read Moby Dick, or marvel at a Monet, or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work, smoke a pipe, and wonder about the nature of reality. (weakening resolve) You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan. Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose, Lila, to quote Janet Jackson. Lila looks off into the distance, her eyes brimming with tears. As Nathan continues his speech, we move closer and closer into Lila's eyes. Nathan's voice fades into nothing by the time we dissolve. Belonging to something, a person or a society, is a basic human craving. We are communal creatures. This poor soul has no one, nothing... : . - naked, very hairy Lila sits by herself on the cliff and watches the sunset. There's a chill in the air and she shivers and hugs herself. Oh God, have no one. Nothing. You give me this beautiful gift, this glorious sunset. But with no one to say ""isn't that a beautiful sunset"" to, it becomes meaningless, just another stupid sunset. They happen everyday. So what? : . - Lila is hovering over the unconscious Puff. Nathan's voice comes back into focus. He is still speechifying. ...what is it that makes us human, if not the knowledge that we are indeed human? Think of this poor soul's education as the greatest gift we could bestow upon... All right. Great. Grab his feet. We'll throw him in the trunk. : . - Nathan hovers over the Lucite case with the tiny dinner table in it. His assistant, Gabrielle, presses a button, a door opens, and two white mice scurry in. The male pulls out a chair for the female. The female climbs up on the chair, and the male pushes the chair in, then scurries around to the other side of the table and climbs onto his own chair. The Lucite lid over the silverware and salads lifts and both mice pick up the proper forks and begin eating. Nathan scribbles in his notebook. Doctor... Nathan looks up. Gabrielle jerks her head in the direction of a very large Lucite case. Inside, Puff, now dressed in a diaper and connected to all sorts of electrodes, is stirring. Nathan and Gabrielle hurry over. Good morning. Puff groggily takes in his surroundings. This is quite a lot to take in. The white room, the strange apes in strange suits, his own clothing, the wires. After surveying the scene for a moment, Puff becomes frightened and agitated. He tries to escape. Not understanding Lucite, he smashes into it, again and again. He tears at his diaper. Nathan gives a nod to Gabrielle, who presses a button on a panel. An electric shock sends Puff flying. He lies on the floor confused and dazed. After a moment, he gets up and again crashes into the Lucite. Nathan gives the signal to Gabrielle and once again she shocks Puff. He once again gets up and crashes against the Lucite. Again he is shocked. He gets up again, and is about to crash against the Lucite, but he thinks better of it, and squats in place, immobilized. (to Gabrielle) Only three shocks. chimp takes fifteen. This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle? (in love with Nathan) Oui, doctor, oui. (to Puff) Good morning... (to Gabrielle) We need a name for him, don't we? Oui. You decide. Today is your day. Really? My day? Well, had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when was a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute! (giggles girlishly) loved my doggie very much, monsieur. (charmed) Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay? Oui. Perfect! (to Puff) Good morning, Puff Bronfman. 'm Dr. Bronfman and this is my assistant Gabrielle. We're your mommy and daddy while you are here. Gabrielle likes this concept a great deal. She smiles and moves closer to Nathan. (to Puff) How about some salad, son? Gabrielle poises her finger above the button. She winks at Nathan. He blushes. : . - Nathan, carrying a brief case, is walking to his car. Gabrielle hurries to catch up to him. Her high heels click on the pavement. Dr. Bronfman! Dr. Bronfman! Nathan turns. Oh, Hi, Gabrielle. (out of breath) Hi. just wanted to tell you that very much enjoy working with you. (blushes) Now 'm embarrassed that say this. They walk along. No. Don't be. really enjoy hearing that. You're a terrific assistant. Merci. ... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps? Well, don't know. 'm actually on my way to... Now am truly embarrassed. Forgive me. should not have asked such a stupid question. know you are a very important man and... No. Don't be silly. It's just... am a foolish little thing. am pink in my face, no? It is only that have been so lonely lately and... am ashamed. 'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am fired now? Gabrielle pouts. Nathan is charmed. : . - Nathan and Gabrielle sit at a romantic little table in a trendy coffee shop. Thank you so much for accompanying me. Not at all. have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man... but 'm talking too much again, no? Of course not. You're so sweet. Oh, why are there not more men out there like you? Gabrielle starts to cry softly. Nathan doesn't know what to do. His eyes dart around, then: There there. Gabrielle looks up at him appreciatively. She sniffs. You know just the right thing to say. She reaches across the table and touches his hand lightly for a moment. Listen, you're the best assistant 've ever had... Gabrielle. (smiles) like it when you say my name. Is that stupid? : . ' - Nathan, in his pajamas, lies in bed reading. He looks up. What are you doing in there? (..) Nothing. Be right out. The phone rings. Nathan picks it up. Hello? (beat, happily) Oh, hi... Gabrielle! Nathan sits up in bed. (..) Who is it? Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right. Nathan laughs. (..) Who is it? (into phone) Absolutely, Gabrielle. (covering phone, testily) Someone from work! (into phone) Sorry about that, Gabrielle. Uh-huh. Exactly. Nathan laughs. (..) Who from work? (into phone) Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle? Nathan puts down the phone and heads to the bathroom. (..) Who is it, Nathan? Nathan opens the bathroom door. Look, Lila, when 'm on a work... Lila turns with a gasp. She has shaving cream all over her chest. Nathan looks stunned. He backs away. Nathan, ... : . ' - The lights are low. The room is peppered with lit candles. Gabrielle, in a slip, lies on her bed, eating cherries from a bowl, and listening to Nathan and Lila's conversation on speaker. (..) It's hormonal, Nathan. can't help it. 'm sorry. (..) Your entire body? (..) 'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile have to... (..) You have to shave? Like an ape? (..) (crying) Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch! (..) Don't quibble. You know what mean. (..) 'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this. (..) Mad? 'm 'm... disgusted! (..) 'm the same person was before you knew, damn it! Oh God! (..) have to think! have to think! Footsteps and a door slam. Lila is near the phone now and crying in desperate heaves. (..) Oh God, why... do... ... have... to... be... like... Oh, no! Oh, shit! (rustling sound, then into phone) Hello? Hello? Is anyone there? Who's there? Gabrielle calmly pops another cherry in her mouth and hangs up the phone. : . - Nathan, in his pajamas, drives. His face is set in a furious scowl and he drives fast. : . - Gabrielle drives leisurely. She is calm, a slight smile on her face. : . - Nathan paces in front of Puff's Lucite case. Puff watches suspiciously from the corner where he is huddled. The lights are off. But there is a green glow from a couple of exit signs. don't get it. don't get it. don't get it. How could find myself in this mess? This is a mess. This is not a situation understand. This is a mess. How do extricate myself from this mess? Is my girlfriend a man? don't understand. This is not part of any plan. She deceived me. She has hair. (beat) But am being fair? So what if she has hair? Who am to judge? have hair. (beat) But 'm supposed to have hair. am a man. Men are supposed to have hair. (beat) But poor Lila. Think of what she's had to go through. The courage she's had to have in the face of this abomination of nature. should love her all the more. should love every hair on her body. mean, she doesn't mind that have a mortifyingly small... The lights flick on. Nathan turns with a start. It's Gabrielle. She's in an overcoat. She gasps. Oh, Doctor. did not know. 'm sorry to disturb you. just came for some papers left. Gabrielle. No, 'm sorry if startled you. came to think. (beat, remembering) God, Did hang up on you? Oui. Perhaps called at a bad time. am sorry. No. just got distracted. 'm so sorry. Is everything fine? Oui. (laughs) Now you've got me talking French. (laughs) was in my p.j.'s when remembered left some papers need to go over. (opens overcoat to reveal lingerie) See? rushed right out of the house. must look a mess. 'm so embarrassed. (taken) 'm in my p.j.'s, too. Funny, huh? Puff is taken also. His eyes are wide. Coincidence, yes? (beat) And how is our son? Our...? Oh! (laughs, out of control) He seems fine. guess we woke him. The lights and all. should turn them off. (she does) Maybe sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when was a little girl. (a little giddy) When you were a little French girl? Oui. (back in control) That would be good. Gabrielle kneels by Puff's case. Puff crawls over, tries to touch her through the Lucite. Gabrielle sings a French lullaby. It's very sweet. Nathan watches her, looks at her thigh, her hair, the delicate way the tip of her nose moves when she sings. Puff gets drowsy. He curls up on the floor and sleeps. (quietly to Nathan) There. Nathan stares at her, transfixed. She pretends not to notice. Shall we close up, then? Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful. It's nice, yes. 'm glad ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no? Yes. Happy happy. Yet you look so sad. great man like you should not be sad. 'm fine. Life is funny, that's all. Gabrielle stands. She stretches languorously, revealing a lot of leg. am sleepy. shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, know. Really? always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. wallflower. (buying her line) Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident. Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment. It's true. wouldn't lie. You are sweet. Gabrielle walks slowly by Nathan. He inhales deeply, breathing her in. She smiles to herself. He reaches out touches her leg. (vaguely protesting) Doctor. She moves into Nathan. She presses her thigh against his shoulder. Nathan leans forward, kisses her exposed thigh. So soft. So smooth. (back to reality) 'm sorry. It's just... (soothing) Shh. : . - Lila is shaving herself all over. Shaving and weeping. There are nicks all over her body. She has no eyebrows any more. The hair on her head is hacked off. : . - Nathan and Gabrielle are lying naked on the floor. Gabrielle rests her head on Nathan's chest. Was that okay? mean, was able to... satisfy you? You are an animal. Really? Wow! That's that's terrific to hear from someone so... feminine, so female. love being female because it, how do you say, allows me to be close to men. 'm glad you're female. (beat) Do you think our boy witnessed the primal scene? Anyway it's time he grew up. 'est- ce pa? (sighing, running her fingers along his chest) love chest hair on a man. know it isn't fashionable now, hairy men. But to me it is the very sign of masculinity. Nathan tenses. Gabrielle looks up innocently at him. What is wrong, my darling? Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world. Puff watches from his case. Gabrielle smiles to herself. . - Puff testifies. saw it, gentlemen. saw the whole sweaty, passionate, ugly, beautiful act, and to use the vernacular, wanted me some of that. The congressmen laugh appreciatively. The laughter is a little too enthusiastic and goes on a little too long. It stops abruptly. And think understood from that moment, that in order to get some, would have to do what they said. In order to experience this primal, basic, animal thing, would first have to become a civilized, prissy, uptight human. would have to become Nathan. The congressmen nod sadly, in recognition of this reality. : . - Puff, in his Lucite case, sits behind a set dinner table. He seems attentive, calm, interested as Nathan teaches him table manners. Gabrielle stands very close, almost possessively close, to Nathan. She wears a lab coat, but it is unbuttoned, and underneath she is wearing a skin-tight black minidress. She strokes the back of Nathan's head as he works with Puff. (slow. talking to an idiot) Excellent, Puff. Now, the lady you're with excuses herself to go powder her nose. The wheels turn in Puff's head. He thinks hard. Then he stands. Gabrielle shrieks and claps happily. Perfect. Perfect, Puff! Nathan leans over and kisses Gabrielle. Puff watches. He makes an exaggerated kissy-face, pursing his lips, trying to imitate Nathan. The phone rings. Gabrielle pulls herself away, giggles as Nathan tries to keep her from going, and picks up the phone. (still giggling) Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please. (puts it on hold) Lila. Shit. (takes phone) Hi, honey. : . ' - Lila sits on the couch. Eyebrows are attractively drawn onto her face. She wears a very femme blonde wing. Lots of make- up. So, how's it going today? (..) Good. Making progress. Honey, can we talk tonight? You know, about stuff? Things have been so strained for the past three weeks, since you know, and just want to talk. : . - Nathan, phone cradled between shoulder and ear, puts his face in his hand. Gabrielle rests a hand on his shoulder. Everything's fine, honey. We don't need to talk. Besides have to work late. (..) Please, Nathan. really need this. You've been working late a lot. Nathan looks up helplessly at Gabrielle. Okay, we'll have dinner tonight. Gabrielle gets mad, exhales sharply, pulls her hand away. Nathan gives her a pleading look, grabs for her. She moves away. Yeah. Okay. Be home around seven. Bye. (hangs up) What? 'm sorry. What was supposed to do? (disgusted) don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do? You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem. Funny. thought that's exactly what you did. You just don't have the courage to admit it to yourself. : . - Nathan talks. tear runs down his face, mingles with the blood. Funny. still feel guilt. Even dead. One would've hoped... But alas. You know, really did love Lila. But with her... problem... and then when Gabrielle revealed her feelings. And Gabrielle was so... conventionally female. And she had an accent. was lost from that moment on. But Gabrielle was right. couldn't admit it to myself, this shallowness of character, let alone to Lila. : . - Lila and Nathan eat. Lila is in her new, very feminine make- up, wig, and dress. Her table manners are impeccable, almost robotic. There is an awkward silence Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan? just have to know. Of course not. It would just be helpful to know. No. Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... don't know. It feels different. 'm just preoccupied. Do you like my new look? Yeah. It's nice. It's really good. 'm trying, you know. (starting to cry) 'm trying to be what you want. want to be what you want, Nathan. All want is to be what you want. (embarrassed) Shh. It's okay. (takes her hand) It's okay, Lila. You're what want. You know that. You're exactly what want. (hopefully, sniffing) Really? Sure. Of course. Because 'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis. (hard to stomach) That's great. 've signed up for a ballet class. And look at my nails! real girl! Lila holds out her hands. Her finger nails are polished fire engine red. That's great. It's a great color for you. Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby! : . - Lila holds and rocks a swaddled baby. She passes it to Nathan, who looks at it and sees that it's a baby monkey. Nathan shudders. Lila looks on lovingly, oblivious. : . ' - Nathan sits with his head in his hands. Wendall listens attentively. So anyway, that's the nightmare 've been having lately. Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body? (beat) No, why? Well, it seems that since Lila broached the subject of children, you've been on edge and know you have an issue with the, uh, body hair. (revelation) Oh, see. Yes, that's something to think about. That's very good. That's what you get the big bucks, right? Ha ha. just think it might be important to explore your feelings for Lila. love Lila. mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no small potatoes. mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And she's a good person. truly good person. How rare is that in this world, eh? And how could stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. mean, God knows 'm not perfect! What about my eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! Lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis? And how do you feel about Gabrielle? Nathan puts his head in his hands and sighs. : . - Nathan is holding flash cards up to Puff. Puff tentatively reads aloud from the cards. Gabrielle sits nearby on a stool, fish-netted legs crossed, arms crossed, and an angry expression on her face. Good-eve-n-ing-lay-dees-and-gent- elmen. Bravo, Puff! Bravo! Puff smiles happily. Nathan and Puff both look over at Gabrielle for her approval. None is forthcoming. Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey? Hmmmph. Gabby, what is it? Hmmph. Hmmph. (beat) Nathan, we have to talk, you and . Fine. Not in front of the boy. Very well. Gabrielle stands, turns, and stomps across the room. Nathan follows her angry, switching hips with his eyes, as does Puff. She exits into the hall. Nathan looks at Puff and shrugs. Puff returns the shrug. Nathan follows Gabrielle into the hall. : . - Gabrielle stands there waiting, a troubled look on her face, her eyes brimming. Nathan emerges, tries to embrace her. My little French. (pushing him away) Stop. Get away. What is it? You have to choose Nathan. It's like Sophie's choice. Only it is Nathan's choice. Did you ever see that movie, Sophie's Choice? It is like that. Only it is this. Gabby, you know 'm trying to sort things out. (hard) No! It is now that you must decide. (soft) love you, Doctor Nathan... (hard) ...but will not wait. will not be your chippy. will not be your little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side dish. (soft) My love. want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly... from you. Nathan gets a faraway look in his eyes. : . - Nathan and Gabrielle sit on a blanket on this otherwise empty beach. There is a light breeze. Gabrielle has one of her breasts exposed and is nursing an infant. Nathan looks at the baby's face. It is angelic. He looks up and smiles at Gabrielle. She smiles back. They kiss. : . - Nathan snaps out of his reverie, looks pleadingly at the waiting Gabrielle. love you so much, Gabrielle. But?... But? There is a ""but,"" Nathan. But don't know how to leave Lila. Gabrielle tears off her lab coat. Underneath she is wearing practically nothing, a skimpy black dress. She throws the lab coat at Nathan, turns and storms down the hall. Nathan watches until she disappears around the corner. (quietly) Now there's a butt, Nathan. He brings the lab coat up to his face and breathes in her fragrance. : . ' - Lila, all prettied up and civilized and manicured, is setting the table for dinner. She is humming. Nathan walks in the door. Lila doesn't hear him. He stands in the doorway for a moment, watching Lila from behind. His face is blank. Lila catches sight of him. She's startled. Oh! (laughs) didn't see you there, sneaky boy! (runs over and kisses him) You're like a boy sneaking in... (so bored) ...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed. You remember that from my book? 'm touched! (kisses him again) What's wrong? Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink. 'll make it. (beats him to the portable bar) 'm so happy, Nathan! Everything's going to be so great! Scotch on the rocks, right? (giggles) Just kidding. know what you drink, mister. know what you drink. (pours and blends and shakes, etc.) Voila! Lila hands Nathan a frothy pink concoction with a pineapple wedge sticking out of it. Thanks. Nathan stares contemplatively out the window and sips his drink. Lila watches him, comes up behind him, puts her arms around him. Nathan cringes, but tries to cover it. Lila feels the cringe, but pretends not to have. She keeps her arms around him for a moment longer, then casually removes them. (fishing) How's work? Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied? (pouty) No. don't want your work to be cruddy. My assistant quit today. Okay? He was highly valuable to the project. Oh, baby. 'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else? guess. Lila screws up her face in concentration, trying to come with a viable solution to Nathan's problem. Hey! could come work for you! know haven't been all that supportive of this project, but 've come around. Have you? Oh yes, baby! think that this is a wonderful project you're doing, taking this poor unfortunate, uncivilized creature and turning him into a human being! What a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are! Really? Yes! And want to help. You won't have to pay me, and was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway. How come? Who needs it? have you and have being a woman and have thinking about womanly things! love being a woman because... Such as what womanly things? Such as my man and how to please him! (kisses him) Such as making wonderful dinners for my man! (kisses him again, leads him to the table, sits him down) Such as looking pretty for my man! (kisses him again) And 'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal! : . - had sold my fucking soul. : . - let her sell her soul. stood by as she did it. It's inexcusable. (beat) At the time though thought it might help. : . - When she came to work with Nathan, she seemed different, gentlemen, don't know, somehow soulless. : . - Puff is in his case in formal evening wear in a makeshift opera box. There is a mannequin woman sitting next to him and a boom box pumping out Beethoven's Fidelio. Puff seems attentive, refined, occasionally bringing a pair of opera glasses up to his eyes, pinky extended. Outside the case, Nathan and Lila look on. The opera is over. Puff stands, applauds, yells ""Bravo"", and tosses a rose in the direction of the imaginary stage. The rose hits the Lucite wall and falls to the floor. Nathan and Lila stand and applaud Puff. Bravo to you, Puff! That was wonderful! Puff smiles and performs a foppish bow, almost a curtsy. He picks up the rose, sniffs it, dramatically savoring its scent. : . ' - Nathan and Gabrielle are having sex. They are focused and intent, although Gabrielle keeps chatting. You were wonderful today, darling. Such authority with the ape-man boy. It made me so hot for you. Unnhh. The way you are taming him, it sends chills down my girlish spine and... everywhere else, too. Urgh. Take me, darling! Tame your little monkey of love! There is a mutual climax. moment of silence, then a spent Nathan rolls off onto his side of the bed. We see that it is really Lila in bed with him, not Gabrielle. (sighing) Well, 'm tamed, Dr. Bronfman. Nathan stares up at the ceiling. 'm glad... my assistant. : . - We see a montage of interactions between Nathan, Puff, and Lila. 1) Nathan demonstrates the proper way to taste wine: sniffing the cork, swishing the wine around in the glass, sipping, nodding in the affirmative to the waiter. Puff, inside his case, imitates it perfectly. 2) Nathan shows Puff a flashcard which reads: ""'ll start tonight with the foie gras."" 3) Puff is holding up a small hand mirror and trimming nose hairs. Lila applauds. 4) Puff juggles three balls while riding a unicycle. 5) Puff, dressed as Peter Pan, stands with legs spread and hands on hips. He is singing "" Gotta Crow."" 6) Puff, dressed in an apron and chef's hat, is tossing a salad. There are two types of vinegar to choose from. He hesitates, then chooses the balsamic. Nathan and Lila applaud. 7) Puff, in a smoking jacket and smoking a pipe, is sitting in an easy chair, next to a fake fire and a fake sleeping dog, and reading a book of poems by Yeats. Lila and Nathan, outside the case, applaud and embrace. think he's ready. Oh boy! (jumping up) Oh boy! Now, Puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar. don't think we'll need to shock you, but just in case. Okay. That's fair. Nathan unlocks the case. Puff tentatively steps out into the world. He hugs Nathan. It's a grateful, obsequious, slightly pathetic hug. Nathan hugs him back, but he's keeping him at a distance. Puff pulls himself out of the hug, but still rests his hands on Nathan's shoulders and looks him in the eye, almost like a lover. Then he parts with Nathan and goes over to embrace Lila. She graciously receives him. After a moment in the embrace, Puff starts dry-humping Lila. Lila can't get out of his clutches. No, Puff! Bad! Nathan presses a button, which shocks Puff and sends him flying. Puff appears disoriented, then gets up off the floor, brushes himself off, and turns to Lila with a bow of his head. My apologies, madam. It's okay, Puff. Shan't happen again. : . - Lila, Nathan, and Puff walk along. Puff is astounded by everything he sees. He looks with wonderment at the tall buildings, the cars, the many different types of people. He looks like an idiot. : . - Puff, Lila, and Nathan are eating lunch. Everything is very proper. Puff is doing wonderfully. This is great, Puff. You're doing fine. 'm loving this. It's such a treat to be out and about. What a wonderful invention a city is. The immense buildings of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon sun, the smartly dressed women in their best summer frocks, the colorful street vendors. The waitress comes by. How is everything? Just spectacular. Great salmon. Fantastico! You've got to give me the recipe! My compliments to the chef! 'm glad you... Puff stands and grabs her and starts humping her. Puff, no! Nathan presses a button on a small black box. Puff falls to the floor. The waitress looks on, sort of confused. And will that be all today? : . - Lila, Nathan, and Puff are in the back seat of the moving taxi. It shan't happen again. swear it. 'm just getting my sea legs, you know. (patting Puff on the back) It's an animal urge, Puff. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Lila! Tell him. Lila looks at Nathan, amends her statement. (to Puff) You just have to control it. We're not apes. Thank you very much for that. : . - Puff is sitting in a chair and facing a screen. The collar is around his neck. Nathan and Lila stand behind him at a slide projector. don't think this aversion therapy is really necessary, doctor. understand the problem. Humor me, Puff. It's essential that am able to trust you to function independently in the world. bow to your expertise in these matters. Lila? Lila dims the lights and switches on the projector. An image of a pretty, fully clothed woman appears on the screen. Puff's eyes widen, but he remains seated. Good. You're doing fine. The slide changes to a naked woman standing in a neutral position, no expression on her face. Puff twitches, but stays seated. Excellent. The slide changes to another photo of the same woman in the same position, but with a seductive smile on her face. Puff clutches the arms of the chairs. You're doing very nicely, Puff. 'm pleased. The slide changes to another picture of the same woman, this time she is naked, has her back to the camera, is sticking her butt out, and looking over her shoulder at the viewer with shiny, heavily lipsticked, pursed lips. Puff is shaking. Great... Puff leaps out of his chair screaming and lunges for the screen. Nathan grabs the black box and jolts him. Puff goes flying in the air and lands with a crack. He heaves for a while, then leaps up and runs for the screen again. Again Nathan shocks him. Again he lands on the floor. He heaves, stands, lunges for the screen again. Nathan shocks him. This happens seven more times. Smoke is pouring out from the collar. Puff struggles to his feet. Looks at the screen. He shrugs. (unimpressed) Eh. Puff sits down in his chair, and studies his finger nails. Nathan switches off the projector. Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert tonight. Yahoo! Tomorrow, the acid test. : . - This is a Hooters-type establishment called ""Chester's."" The waitresses are very busty and in Tight t-shirts which are emblazoned with the name of the restaurant. Lila, Nathan, and Puff sit at a table. Puff studies his menu intently, not daring to look up. Lila looks around uncomfortably. waitress approaches. ' How you all doin' today? (cheerily) Very well. (awkwardly) Very well. (looking down) Very well. ' Good enough! What can get for you? Puff, why don't you order first? (looking at menu) Uh, what's a Reuben, please? The waitress leans over to study the menu. Her breasts are in Puff's face. ' The what, honey? Oh, the Reuben? That's a sandwich with corned beef and sauer... That's fine. That's what 'll have. Corned beef is a good food. : . - Lila, Nathan, and Puff walk along. Puff, 'm proud of you! You did remarkably well under difficult circumstances. Absolutely! Puff jumps up and down excitedly. Did ? tried so hard! really concentrated! Oh, 'm so happy! And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you. (happily) Extra dessert? Even better. : . - Lila, Nathan, and Puff enter. Puff sees his Lucite case. It has been transformed into a bachelor pad. Inside is a king-size bed, a , a couch, coffee table, shelves lined with books, a small kitchenette. There is a curtain which can be drawn for privacy. Puff is taken aback. Surprise! Puff gasps and runs into the room. He is thrilled. Nathan holds up a key. Free to come and go as you please. There's some ""mad money"" in the night table drawer. (taking the key, hugging Nathan) It's wonderful! Do you think 'm ready? Do you really? trust that you'll make good, mature decisions. trust that you'll do the proper thing. Oh, will! (gravely) Your very trust has instilled an enormous sense of responsibility in me. don't want to disappoint you. Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't ever do what you really want to do. (taking it in) Got it. : . ' - Lila and Nathan sit as far as possible from each other and read books. Nathan looks at his watch. : . ' - Puff, dressed identically to Nathan, reads Moby Dick and smokes a pipe. He distractedly taps his foot, stands and studies a Monet print on the wall. His foot is still nervously tapping. He checks his watch. : . ' - Nathan stands. 'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up. (stretching) Should come with? Nah. You just relax. How's the book? (lazily, happily) Ummm. It's good. Nathan kisses Lila on the forehead. won't be long. : . - Nathan drives with a determined look on his face. : . ' - The apartment is a mess. Every single light is on. Gabrielle is lounging in a stained nightshirt with a dopey cartoon bear on the front. She's got some sort of pimple medication dabbed on her face. She unconsciously but ferociously bites her nails as she watches and talks on the phone. There is no trace of a French accent. (into phone) You're kidding! Holy shit. (beat) Yeah, no duh! had a wild hair up my ass over that for a month. There's a knock at the door. Yeah? What? (..) Hi. It's Nathan. Gabrielle's eyes widen. She jumps up from the couch and starts straightening. (into phone) Call you back. (hangs up, assumes French accent) You bastard! What do you want? (..) just want to talk. (ripping off her nightshirt) We have nothing to say! You are a rotten bastard, that's what! : . - Nathan stands there leaning against the door. Please. Just one minute of your time. (..) Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now hate you! No, don't hate you; don't even think about you! 've got some things to tell you. : . ' - Gabrielle is standing in front of a mirror, holding different sexy outfits up to herself, trying to decide. Like what? (..) Well, think it would be easier if could talk to you in person. What for? : . - We hear banging and rustling and arranging coming from inside the apartment. Well, think... (..) You think too much. need a man who doesn't think so much but acts more than he thinks... is what need! What? You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what am saying to you! Go away from here! (turning away) Well, look, 'm sorry to have bothered you. He starts to head down the hall. (..) (beat, then screaming) All right, already! Come in if you must! The door's open, you son of a bitch! Nathan heads back to the apartment, tries the knob. The door's open. He enters. : . ' - The lights are low. The place is neat. Cool jazz plays quietly in the background. Candles are lit. Gabrielle is nowhere to be found. Nathan takes it all in. It's quite seductive. (..) In here, you lousy piece of merde. Nathan follows her voice. He exits into the bedroom. : . ' - Candles in here also. Gabrielle, now made up and in a satin teddy, lounges in bed, eating cherries from a bowl. Nathan just stares. She is slightly out of breath, but trying to conceal it. film of perspiration glistens on her brow. (testy) Well? God, you're beautiful. Please. look a mess. No. You look so beautiful. Anyway. Come already to the point. 'm... 'm going to leave Lila. can't stop thinking about you. 've moved on. No! 've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry. (raging) That goddamn Neanderthal? 'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?! (calm, dismissive) That's not how he tells it. Of course not, that Swedish thief! He's a thief of hearts! (beat) love you, Gabrielle. (dismissive) Hunh. Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and don't want to hurt her more than is necessary. (beat) You hurt me, you know, when you made Nathan's Choice. Does that not even matter to you, you pig? Gabrielle cries quietly. Nathan moves closer to her. He strokes her hair. Can you ever forgive me? Gabrielle looks up at him. Her expression is noncommittal and pouty, but she grabs his arm and pulls him down on top of her. : . - Puff, dressed a bit like he's a Victorian dandy, sits in the front row and watches a naked woman on stage dancing. topless cocktail waitress comes by with a fresh drink for him. She takes away his empty glass. He is horribly drunk and holding himself with exaggerated rigidity -- an amateur drinker's attempt to look sober. : . ' - Nathan enters. Lila sits on the couch still reading. She looks up. Hey. Nathan kisses her on the forehead. You were gone a long time. (sits down next to her) Yeah. Puff and got into a big, philosophical discussion. He's really quite well read, considering he's only been literate for a month now. He's going to make us famous, Lila. So he's doing okay? Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs. That's funny because, you know, just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his ""mad"" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore! (then casually) Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey? Shit. And what did you do tonight, honey? 've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila. (pointedly) And what did you do tonight, honey? fucked her! Okay? fucked her. 'm sorry. But that's what the hell did. (standing) Do you know what gave up to be with you? Yes. gave up my soul, my beliefs. gave up my body hair! Yeah, well, 'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing. How the hell would you know anything about the human heart? (moving to her) Lila... Lila turns around and slugs him, square on the jaw, hard, knocking him to the floor. How's that for ladylike, Nathan. Lila opens up the hall closet and pulls out a suitcase. : . - Lila looks pale and shaken. She smokes. For two weeks holed myself up in a motel room. didn't even know who was. My world had crumbled. There is nothing that makes you feel dirtier than finally deciding to sell your soul and finding no buyers. : . - Lila lies in bed watching . She is a mess. The room is a mess. The wig is off. There's hair sprouting on her face. The curtains are drawn. There is a knock at the door. No maid service! For God's sake, can't you read the fucking ""do not disturb"" sign on the fucking doorknob? (..) Lila, it's Rosie. (beat) Go the fuck away, Rosie. (..) Please, honey, let me in. Rose, please go away. (..) Lila, want to help you. Lila gets up, drags herself to the door, and opens it. Rose stands there trying not to let it show how lousy Lila looks. How'd you know where was? Nathan told my brother. Your brother should have his license revoked. Yeah, although 'm not going to turn him in. like hearing the dirt. (suddenly crying) Why didn't your brother tell you that Nathan was having an affair? Rose holds Lila, who hangs on her as she weeps. don't know, honey. don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved. Oh, Rosie. Let's get you out of here. Come stay with me until you get your strength back. (cheerily) Free electrolysis, if you want it! We'll get that face of yours cleared up in no time. Lila mulls it over. She looks back at the hotel room. It's depressing. She sniffs in her snot. Yeah. gotta get myself together. want to look good. If 'm gonna fuck with Nathan, and am, want him to want to fuck me when do it. : This sequence is Lila getting her strength back, both emotional and physical. It is intercut with scenes of Nathan and Gabrielle taking Puff on the lecture circuit. 1) Lila eating a good breakfast. 2) Lila struggling to do push-ups. 3) Lila getting electrolysis on her face. 4) Lila reading Nietzsche. 5) Lila jogging. : . - bearded psychologist addresses a crowd of bearded psychologists. ...and so without further ado, give you Dr. Nathan Bronfman and Puff. The room bursts into applause as Nathan and Puff walk out onstage, both in tuxes. Nathan stands behind a podium, Puff sits casually, legs crossed, in a chair. Thank you. Let's get right to it. Here we have Puff the day of his capture. video of Puff naked in his Lucite case, clawing at it, shrieking like a banshee, and neurotically hopping up and down, is projected onto a screen behind Nathan. There is a collective gasp from the audience. Puff watches the video with amused detachment. The video stops. And here he is today, a scant three months later. Puff stands, bows slightly to the audience. They burst into vigorous applause. Puff, why don't you say a few words to the assemblage. It would be my pleasure, doctor. (behind podium) Distinguished gentlemen and ladies of the psychological community, stand before you today, a living testament to the amazing skill of Dr. Nathan Bronfman. To say that he took me from crayons to perfume would be a vast understatement. Dr. Bronfman took me from playing with my own feces, then to crayons, and then to an appreciation of the complex works of Franz Kline, Joseph Beuys, and Marcel Duchamp. From compulsive masturbation to... : . - Gabrielle waits in the wings. (..) And, so, goodnight, adieu, until we meet again, au revoir. The audience bursts into thunderous applause. Gabrielle joins in. Nathan and Puff hurry off stage. Gabrielle embraces Nathan. You were wonderful! Was ? wasn't a tad stiff? Don't be silly! (hugs Puff) And you were wonderful, too! loved the way you said "" au revoir."" Puff and Gabrielle exchange a look. She discreetly pinches Puff's butt, smiles, winks. Nathan doesn't see this. He puts his arm around Gabrielle. Come on, you two. Let's go celebrate! Nathan and Gabrielle walk on ahead. Puff tags behind, watching Gabrielle's delightful walk. : . - Puff sits up on his bed, looking dejected. He listens to the sounds of Nathan and Gabrielle having sex in the adjoining room. He looks at his watch, gets up, gets dressed. : . - sweaty, sick-looking Puff watches a porno film in a little booth. It ends. He steps out into the fluorescent glare of the store. He walks out past several skulking degenerates. : . - Puff exits the bookstore, walks down the street checking out the tawdry hookers. He chooses one. She leads him into a dark alley. : 6) Lila in a Tai Chi class. 7) Lila doing jumping jacks. 8) Lila reading The Art of War. 9) Lila doing stomach crunches. 10) Lila doing chin ups. 11) Lila swimming laps. 12) Lila getting more electrolysis. : . - Puff is on stage demonstrating his ballroom dancing technique. He is waltzing with Gabrielle. Nathan stops the music, and picks up a microphone. Now the tango. Nathan puts a tango record on. Gabrielle and Puff perform expertly. The audience applauds. : . - Gabrielle, Nathan, and Puff are eating dinner. think it went swimmingly today. You two make an excellent team. Gabrielle and Puff look at each other. She touches Puff's knee under the table. Nathan is busy eating. : . - Puff paces as he listens to sex noises from the next room. : . - Puff walks along checking out the prostitutes. He signals to one with a nonchalant jerk of his head. : 13) Lila doing one-handed push-ups. 14) Lila rolling on the ground with a rifle. 15) Lila, in boxing gloves, punching a bag. 16) Lila reading the Kama Sutra. 17) Lila getting electrolysis. : . - Puff addresses the crowd. Lila and Nathan look on adoringly from the wings. To be taken from the depths of ignorance and depravity and raised to heights of culture and refinement! This is the priceless gift bestowed upon me by Dr. Nathan Bronfman. Thunderous applause. : . - Puff leans against the wall drinking whiskey from a bottle, as a prostitute, down on her knees in front of him, does her business. The look on his face is not one of pleasure or even release. It is a look of decay. : 18) Lila does chin ups. Her sweaty, muscular arms glisten in the sun. 19) Lila wind sprinting. 20) Lila getting electrolysis. Rose moves away from her. Done! (standing triumphantly) Ready! : . - Nathan and Gabrielle, in lab coats, sit chatting with Puff. Puff sneaks glances at Gabrielle's legs and cleavage. She makes his viewing possible. (off clipboard) So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men. Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous. Nathan kisses Gabrielle. Thanks to you, Nate. Thanks to you, Buddy. And your diligence and intelligence and perseverance. Puff blushes. (to Gabrielle) And of course to you, my sweet, for your... moral support. (applauding) here, here. Gabrielle kisses Nathan while glancing at Puff. midget in a business suit enters. It's the sour-looking guy from the freak show. Excuse me, are you Dr. Bronfman? Is that a little boy? (teaching) No, Puff. This man is a midget. In actuality, they prefer to be called ""Little People."" Isn't that correct, my good man? Yes sir. Little People. This Little Person is actually a fully grown adult man, Puff, believe it or not, who, due to a genetic anomaly, is miniature but perfectly proportioned. (to midget) Turn, please. The midget turns. (jotting in notebook) Interesting. Now, my diminutive friend, what can do for you? The midget pulls out a gun. You can get into that goddamn Lucite bachelor pad for starters, Goliath. Nathan, Gabrielle, and Puff look frightened. They stand and back into the case. (to Puff) Not you, Joyboy. Puff stops in his tracks. Nathan and Gabrielle continue to back into the case. What is this about? We have no money on these premises. Please if you are from some little person terrorist fringe group... (loud and scary) Shut up! Nathan and Gabrielle hurry into the case. The midget closes and locks the door behind them. Puff is frozen with fear. Lila enters. She looks different now. Savage. Strong. Kind of sexy. She wears guerilla-like black clothing and a beret over her closely hacked-off hair. She also carries a gun. Lila? That's Lila? Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. And don't let the hirsutism fool you. know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie. Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you? Eat shit, thumbtack dick! (to Midget) Thank you, Frank. You're the best. Lila kisses the midget on the top of the head. Anything for you, Lila. See, Frank and are kindred spirits. We both know what it's like to be shunned because of our appearance. We both know how easily that turns into self-hatred. Amen. Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition! Rose enters hurriedly, carrying rope. She bends over and kisses Frank hard on the mouth for a long moment, then: (to Lila) Sorry 'm late, parking is a bitch at this place. Lila looks over and sees the two trained mice in the Lucite case sitting at a tiny table and very politely eating their lunch. One of the mice makes eye contact with Lila. : . - Lila is naked in the bathroom and about to kill herself when she makes eye contact with the mouse on the shelf next to the tub. : . - Lila brings her focus back to the room. Everyone is watching her, waiting for some direction. Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will. With pleasure. Frank keeps the gun on Gabrielle and Nathan. Rose enters the case and begins to tie them up and gag them. : . - Puff is sitting in the car. The electronic collar is back around his neck. Lila holds the black control box, and the Lucite case with the two mice in it. She stands outside the car with Frank and Rose. 'm going to miss you. Oh, Rosie. And 'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me. Shut up, you. Lila laughs and hugs her. like you so much, with or without hair. (confidentially) But don't spread that around. Bad for business. 'm really glad you two found each other. Frank and Rose put their arms around each other. Frank is exactly crotch-high to Rose. We're soul mates. Souls have nothing to do with it, babe. 'll be in touch. No you won't. But it's okay. You have stuff you gotta do. Lila tears up. So does Rose. They just stand there for a moment, then: (choked) Gotta go. Lila hurries around the car, gets in, and drives off. Rose and Frank embrace. Frank nestles. Rose sighs contentedly. : . - Lila's car drives along. Puff looks nervously out the window. : . - Lila and Puff are driving in silence on a dirt road through the woods. Lila pulls off the road, drives to a place where the car will be camouflaged, and parks. Stay. Puff stays in the car. Lila gets out, pulls the Lucite mouse case from the back seat. : . - Lila puts the case on the ground and unlatches it. The mice looks confused at first. Then the male mouse pushes the door open and holds it for the female mouse, who exits. The male mouse follows her, and closes the door behind him. He turns to Lila, nods, then extends his arm for the female mouse to hold on to. She does, and they walk off together on their hind legs into the woods. Lila sighs, and turns to Puff. Out. Puff gets out casually, then makes a mad dash for the road. Lila calmly presses the button on her black box. Puff spasms and falls to the ground. Bad. Puff stays on the ground, breathing hard. Get up. Puff does. Take off your clothes. Puff does. So does Lila. She is covered with hair, except for her face. But whereas Puff is now white and soft-looking, Lila is tan and taut and muscular. This is a reversal of the way both of them were when they first met. Puff seems taken with her body. We're going back to nature, you and . 'm going to retrain you. 'm going to make you free again if have to kill you doing it. But like being human now. Lila shocks Puff. He falls to the ground. You what? want to be the way was before. (sweet) Good. 'll show you how, apey. : . - Puff and Lila have built makeshift shelter out of leaves and twigs. They are sitting around a campfire, naked and dirty, roasting a couple of skinned squirrels on sticks. The black box rests in Lila's lap. Puff looks at the roasting squirrel, is repulsed. Nice night. Talking is to be kept to a minimum. Eventually, when we are ready, there will be none. Language was invented so that people could lie to each other and to themselves. There is no other reason. Puff begins to disagree. Lila's hand hovers over the button. He stops himself. (confused) agree? Lila shocks Puff. You lose. Any answer is the wrong answer. : . - Puff and Lila lie seperately under blankets of moss. The breathing is heavy. Both seem to be sleeping. Puff opens his eyes and tries to extricate himself from the moss without making any noise. Lila presses the button and Puff falls in a quivering mess. (whisper) You'll thank me eventually, Puff. Well, you won't thank me, because we won't be speaking, but you'll sort of thank me with a special look, the look a dog gives you to let you know he loves you. What an enchanting picture you paint of our future together. Lila shocks Puff once again. As he spasms, we: : . - Puff testifies. And so commenced my reeducation, gentlemen. Lila taught me so much. She was a stern but fair teacher. And over time, began to remember the carefree joy of living in a pure state of being. But something else happened as well, something perhaps distinctly human... began to fall in love with Lila. : . - Lila and Puff are naked and collecting mushrooms and berries. Time has passed. Both Lila and Puff are dirtier and hairier. Puff still wears his collar. Lila bends over to pick a mushroom. Puff looks at her from behind. Boy, you look so good from this ang... Lila turns, puts her finger to her lips in a gentle ""no talking"" reminder, then shocks the hell out of Puff. He spasms and falls on top of her, knocking her to the ground. He regains his composure, finds himself on top of Lila. They look at each other for a moment. Then they kiss. It's a violent kiss. They grope each other. This is primal sex now. In the dirt. Sweaty. Loud grunting. Lila even presses the shock button at the right moment. Puff seems to like it in this context. : . ' - Nathan and Gabrielle are in bed, making love. It is gentle, romantic, in good taste -- in direct contrast to the animal, violent sex Puff and Lila are having. They finish. Nathan pulls himself off of Gabrielle and falls onto his back, staring up at the ceiling. penny for your thoughts, mon cheri. don't know. Something's missing. : . - Gabrielle, Nathan, and Nathan's parents eat dinner. Nathan's parents are in clown make-up. There is a long silence. Nathan is still sad. Gabrielle steals glances at Nathan's parents. Finally Nathan speaks. (uninterested) So, Mother and Father, how's Godspell going? How did you know we... The parents look at each other burst out laughing. Tell him, Harold. It's going famously, son, famously! (despondent) 'm glad. Harold, ask Nathan what's wrong. Yes, please, somebody ask him what is wrong. don't know. : . - Nathan and Gabrielle are in bed. Nathan stares up at the ceiling. Finally: want our boy back. (sadly) Oui. That bitch. worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and . He would've made us famous. We still have you and . know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if could find him and bring him back. Where do we look for little lost Puff? have some thoughts. think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape. That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No? You better believe they're dirty! And smelly! And messy! And they don't know their forks from their assholes! Nathan, seemingly in the grips of a sudden horrific migraine, scrunches his face and holds his ears. He relaxes a bit, and gets out of bed. He walks across the room, pulls on some pants, and picks up a container called ""Stop Buggin' Me, Sunny."" 'm going alone. This could be dangerous. (pulling covers up and turning away from him onto her side) Okay, my sweet. Good night. little resistance would be nice, damn it. (without opening her eyes) Please let me go with you. No. Okay. : . - Nathan is driving along a wooded dirt road. He's in his immaculate safari suit. He looks tired. He stops the car, pulls out a gun, and gets out. : . - Nathan gets out of the car and runs into the woods. We follow. (yelling) Aha! He looks around there is no one there. He sighs and walks back to his car, pulls out a map and marks an area with a red . : . - Nathan is in his underwear. He is ironing his safari suit as he talks on the phone. No luck yet, my sweet. We see an unfolded map on the bed. There are red 's in almost all the state parks along the east coast. : . - Lila and puff are having sex again next to a campfire. Now Lila is wearing the collar, and Puff is giving her well timed shocks. They giggle and kiss after they finish. Puff sits up. He holds his stomach and grunts hungrily. Lila grunts back. She stands and retrieves a sack of berries. Puff and Lila greedily, gluttonously stuff their faces. Lila takes some berries and smashes them against Puff's face. She laughs heartily. He looks annoyed for a second, but then grabs a handful and squishes them against Lila's face. Pretty soon they are having a berry war and are covered in purple stains. They hug each other, out of breath and laughing. : . - Lila smiles. It was paradise. (beat, sadly) At least for a tiny little while. : . - Lila and Puff lie naked in a tree, lazily soaking up the midday sun. There is a rustling in the bushes. They both look up, alert but calm. Nathan, immaculate in his safari suit, appears in the clearing. He holds a gun. Aha! Finally. 've covered almost the entire seaboard and parts of eastern Ohio. Ugnh. Ugnh. Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject. Unn. Down from the tree. Both of you. Keep your hands where can see them. Don't want you pulling any weapons out of your fur. Nathan laughs heartily, haughtily, at his joke as Lila and Puff climb down from the tree. Look at you two. You both disgust me. Oook. Oook. Shut up! (to Puff) gave you... life. created you in my image, Puff. took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But 'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit. Ooka. Don't worry, Lila. You can stay. don't have any interest in you anymore. (to Puff) 'mon, monkey boy. Puff looks at Lila. Lila shrugs helplessly. Puff reaches out to touch her hand. Now! Puff looks at Lila again. She jerks her head in the direction of Nathan. Puff sighs and moves to Nathan. Nathan prods Puff, and they head off through the trees. Suddenly Puff elbows Nathan. Nathan grunts, doubles over. Puff turns, lunges, and the two wrestle on the ground. Puff pries the gun from Nathan's hand, and jumps up. Nathan stands also, backing away. Puff has the gun trained on Nathan. Lila runs to Puff, stands behind him. Puff, put the gun down. Ounpoo. Ungh. Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we? (jumping up and down like a chimp) Unka unka unka unka unka. Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. 'll just go on my way. You'll never see me again. (to Lila, guiltily) have to talk. Is that okay? Lila nods. (to Nathan) You did create me in your image, Nathan. Before you was a simple, happy, complete being, in harmony with the world around me. After you became duplicitous, cynical, angry, anal, totally out of touch with my surroundings. In a word, Nathan, became you. Lila has reintroduced me to myself. And, incidentally, what 'm about to do, kill you, is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the Earth. Before when killed, it was for food or in self-defense. Now will kill for revenge. Revenge is an abstract concept, Nathan. And learned abstract thinking from you. No. Puff, don't. Puff shoots. crow screams. The fluttering of wings. The bullet hits Nathan in the head. He falls. : . - Lila sobs. Then shot Nathan. : . - Puff dabs his eye. Then Lila shot Nathan. : . - Nathan talks. Then Puff shot me. Then died. That's all know. That's the end of my story. Do get to go to heaven now? (beat) Or is it... hell? (beat) Or... what? (beat) just stay here, is it? just stay here and tell it again? And after that? Again? And after... (sighs) Yes. Yes, of course. (sighs, clears his throat) We move into an extreme close-up. (beginning again) don't even know what sorry means anymore. It's odd. When was alive knew -- maybe it was all knew... : . - Lila runs to Nathan. She kneels beside him. He's dead. (calmly) We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows. (beat, then quietly) No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here. For all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody. Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear. We'll never talk about it again. We'll never talk again period. love you. Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because knew it was wrong and went along with it anyway. 'm taking responsibility for the murder. want you to go back to your old life. won't let you do that. shot the bastard. And 'm glad. No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, could never be free again anyway, so might as well be in jail. (beat) Then 'll live for both of us, Lila. 'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us. (tearing up) That's what 'm counting on. (an idea) But first 'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind. (shrugs) Okay. If you think it will help. : . - Lila, now in prison coveralls, sits in a dayroom with other women convicts. She is watching a mounted on the wall. Puff is testifying. And so, gentlemen, that is my story. agreed to testify before this committee because hoped to convey to the American public that there is indeed a paradise lost. Human beings have become so enamored of their technologies and their intellectual prowess and their fancy gourmet foods, that they've forgotten to look to the Earth as a teacher. This is hubris, my friends. And my story of destruction and betrayal is proof of that. will keep my promise to Lila. will shed this suit and go back into the wilderness. will live out my days naked and free. Thank you, sir. Your story has touched us all deeply. We will pass some legislation addressing this problem. Thank you. That is all ask. (to camera) Good-bye, Lila. take you with me in my untamed heart. Puff stands and exits the auditorium. Flashbulbs flash. In the prison common room, Lila wipes a tear from her eye. She seems genuinely happy. She looks out a small barred window and sees a bluebird light there, then fly away. : . - Puff walks along, a man on a mission. As he walks he sheds articles of clothing. He is followed by reporters and cameramen and celebrity hounds. Soon he is naked. : . - Puff walks along, naked. People cheer from porches. : . - Puff walks along. He is still followed by reporters. Cows watch the parade. : . - Puff walks along a dirt road. He is about to disappear into the forest. An older woman rushes out from the crowd. Wait! (turning) Yes? saw you on -Span. 've been looking for you for thirty years. Then there you were, such a beautiful, beautiful grown man. The older woman starts to cry. Mother? Yes... Derek. Puff holds out his hand for her to shake. Flashbulbs flash. (formally) It's a pleasure to meet you, mother. But 'm an ape like dad was... (checks watch) And have to go back into the woods now... forever. (resigned) Yes, suppose so. suppose knew that was going to be what you would say. It's good to see you again though. Yes. 'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something. 'm an ape, mom. 'm an ape. And apes don't drop lines. His mother weeps. Puff gently rests his hand on her shoulder for a moment, then he turns and waves to the reporters. The crowd bursts into applause. Flashbulbs flash. Puff jogs into the woods. There is a collective sigh, and then everyone turns and heads back in the direction from which they came. We hold on the woods for a moment. car pulls up. Puff hurries out of the woods and jumps in the passenger side of the car. : . - Puff leans over and kisses Gabrielle, who is driving the car. Hello, my little boy. Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? 'm freezing my ass off. Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked. Great. (putting on suit) God, 've wanted you forever. Gabrielle giggles. Puff kisses her. Say my name. Gabrielle. (eyes glistening) You remind me so much of Nathan. Like father, like son. (stroking his face) You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie. Woof. This turns Gabrielle on. She kisses him passionately. When the kiss runs its course, Puff speaks. Arf. Gabrielle kisses him again, even more passionately this time As much as loved Nathan, 'm not sorry she killed him, if it means can have you. Is that a terrible thing to say, my sweet? (putting her finger to his lips) Hush. No, it is never terrible to be in love. Nathan's memory lives on in our sacred union. (beat) 'm not sorry she killed him either. Nathan was wonderful. He was erudite and sophisticated and charming. You are all that, too. But you have something more. You have a bit of the animal in you. They smile flirtatiously at each other. Puff leans over and kisses Gabrielle's neck. Let's go eat, 'm starved. French? Oui. : . - The car makes a screeching u-turn. It disappears in the direction of the city. When the dust clears, we see the two white mice standing there on the side of the road, shivering and emaciated. The male holds out his the thumb and the female holds a tiny little sign which reads: New York. There is a look of hopelessness in their beady black eyes. . "
